      <lyrics>1.  Come, Thou long-expected Jesus, 
    Born to set Thy people free;
    From our fears and sins release us; 
    Let us find our rest in Thee.

2.  Israel's strength and consolation, 
    Hope of all the earth Thou art;
    Dear desire of every nation, 
    Joy of every longing heart.

3.  Born Thy people to deliver, 
    Born a child and yet a King,
    Born to reign in us forever, 
    Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.

4.  By Thine own eternal Spirit 
    Rule in all our hearts alone;
    By Thine all sufficient merit 
    Raise us to Thy glorious throne.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Comfort, comfort you my people, 
    Tell of peace, thus says our God;
    Comfort those who sit in darkness 
    Bowed beneath oppression's load.
    Speak you to Jerusalem 
    Of the peace that waits for them;
    Tell them that their sins I cover, 
    And their warfare now is over.

2.  For the herald's voice is calling 
    In the desert far and near,
    Bidding us to make repentance 
    Since the kingdom now is here.
    O that warning cry obey!  
    Now prepare for God a way;
    Let the valleys rise in meeting 
    And the hills bow down in greeting.

3.  Make you straight what long was crooked, 
    Make the rougher places plain;
    Let your hearts be true and humble, 
    As befits God's holy reign.
    For the glory of the Lord 
    Now o'er earth is shed abroad;
    And all flesh shall see the token 
    That God's word is never broken.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Creator of the stars of night, 
    Your people's everlasting light, 
    O Christ, Redeemer of us all, 
    We pray You, hear us when we call.

2.  When this old world drew on toward night, 
    You came, but not in splendor bright,
    Not as a monarch, but the child 
    Of Mary, blameless mother mild.

3.  At Your great name, O Jesus, now 
    All knees must bend, all hearts must bow:
    All things on earth with one accord, 
    Like those in heaven, shall call You Lord.

4.  To God the Father, God the Son, 
    And God the Spirit, Three in One,
    Praise, honor, might, and glory be 
    From age to age eternally.  Amen.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Let all mortal flesh keep silence, 
    And with fear and trembling stand;
    Ponder nothing earthly minded, 
    For with blessing in His hand,
    Christ our God to earth descendeth, 
    Our full homage to demand.

2.  King of kings, yet born of Mary, 
    As of old on earth He stood,
    Lord of lords, in human vesture, 
    In the body and the blood,
    He will give to all the faithful 
    His own self for heavenly food.

3.  Rank on rank the host of heaven 
    Spreads its vanguard on the way,
    As the Light of Light descendeth 
    From the realms of endless day,
    That the powers of hell may vanish 
    As the darkness clears away.

4.  At His feet the six-winged seraph; 
    Cherubim, with sleepless eye,
    Veil their faces to the presence, 
    As with ceaseless voice they cry,
    Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Lord Most High!</lyrics>

    See the Lamb for sinners slain!
    Thousand, thousand saints attending 
    Join to sing the glad refrain:
    Alleluia! Alleluia! 
    Alleluia! Christ the Lord returns to reign!

2.  Every eye shall then behold You 
    Robed in awesome majesty;
    Those who jeered and mocked and sold You, 
    Pierced and nailed You to the tree,
    Shamed and grieving, Shamed and grieving, 
    Shamed and grieving, Shall their true Messiah see.

3.  Yes, Amen! Let all adore You 
    High on your eternal throne;
    Crowns and empires fall before You, 
    Claim the kingdom for Your own:
    Come, Lord Jesus, Come, Lord Jesus,  
    Come, Lord Jesus, Everlasting Christ, come down!</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Lord Christ, when first You came to earth, 
    Upon a cross they bound You,
    And mocked Your saving kingship then 
    By thorns with which they crowned You;
    And still our wrongs may weave You now 
    New thorns to pierce that steady brow,
    And robe of sorrow round You.

2.  O wondrous love, which found no room 
    In life, where sin denied You,
    And, doomed to death, must bring to doom 
    The power which crucified You,
    Till not a stone was left on stone, 
    And all a nation's pride, o'er-thrown,
    Went down to dust beside You.

3.  New advent of the love of Christ, 
    Shall we again refuse You,
    Till in the night of hate and war 
    We perish as we lose You?
    From old unfaith our souls release 
    To seek the kingdom of Your peace,
    By which alone we choose You.

4.  O wounded hands of Jesus, build 
    In us Your new creation;
    Our pride is dust, our vaunt is stilled, 
    We wait Your revelation.
    O Love that triumphs over loss, 
    We bring our hearts before Your cross;
    Come, finish Your salvation.</lyrics>

    From earthly use for heaven's employ,
    Adorned with prayer, and love, and joy.

    Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, 
    And death's dark shadows put to flight.
    Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel

    Make straight the way for God within,

3.  We hail You as our Savior, Lord,
    Our refuge, and our great reward;

    A lamp within my breast,

2.  Love caused Your incarnation,
    Love brought You down to me;
    Your thirst for my salvation
    Procured my liberty.
    O love beyond all telling, 
    That led You to embrace
    In love all loves excelling
    Our lost and fallen race.

3.  A glorious crown You give me,
    A treasure safe on high,
    That will not fail nor leave me
    As earthly riches fly.
    My heart shall bloom forever
    For You with praises new,
    And from Your name shall never
    Withhold the honor due.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  People, look east. The time is near 
    Of the crowning of the year.
    Make your house fair as you are able,
    Trim the hearth and set the table.
    People, look east:
    Love the guest is on the way.

2.  Furrows, be glad. Though earth is bare,
    One more seed is planted there:
    Give up your strength the seed to nourish,
    That in course the flower may flourish.
    People, look east:
    Love the rose is on the way.

3.  Birds, though you long have ceased to build,
    Guard the nest that must be filled.
    Even the hour when wings are frozen
    God for fledging time has chosen.
    People, look east:
    Love the bird is on the way.

4.  Stars, keep the watch. When night is dim
    One more light the bowl shall brim,
    Shining beyond the frosty weather,
    Bright as sun and moon together.
    People, look east:
    Love the star is on the way.

5.  Angels, announce with shouts of mirth
    Christ who brings new life to earth.
    Set every peak and valley humming
    With the word, the Lord is coming.
    People, look east and sing today:
    Love the Lord is on the way.</lyrics>

    He comes from heaven above.
    His rule is peace and freedom,
    And justice, truth, and love.
    Lift high your praise resounding,
    For grace and joy abounding.

    Her star is risen, her light grows bright.
    Now come, most worthy Lord,

3.  Lamb of God, the heavens adore You;
    Let saints and angels sing before You,
    As harps and cymbals swell the sound.
    Twelve great pearls, the city's portals:
    Through them we stream to join the immortals
    As we with joy Your throne surround.
    No eye has known the sight, 
    No ear heard such delight:
    Alleluia! Therefore we sing to greet our King;

    To hear the angel's word.
    What was the angel saying?
    It troubled her to hear,
    To hear the angel's message,
    It troubled her to hear.

4.  "Fear not, for God is with you,
    And you shall bear a child.
    His name shall be called Jesus,
    God's offspring from on high.
    And He shall reign forever,
    Forever reign on high."

5.  "How shall this be?" said Mary,
    "I am not yet a wife."
    The angel answered quickly
    "The power of the Most High
    Will come upon you shortly;
    Your child will be God's child."

6.  As Mary heard the angel,
    She wondered at his words.
    "Behold, I am your hand-maid,"
    She said unto her God.
    "So be it, I am ready
    According to your Word."</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Watchman, tell us of the night, 
    What its signs of promise are.
    Traveler, o'er yon mountain's height,
    See that glory-beaming star.
    Watchman, does its beauteous ray
    Aught of joy or hope foretell?
    Traveler, yes; it brings the day,
    Promised day of Israel.

2.  Watchman, tell us of the night,
    Higher yet that star ascends.
    Traveler, blessedness and light,
    Peace and truth its course portends.
    Watchman, will its beams alone
    Gild the spot that gave them birth?
    Traveler, ages are its own;
    See, it bursts o'er all the earth.

3.  Watchman, tell us of the night, 
    For the morning seems to dawn.
    Traveler, darkness takes its flight,
    Doubt and terror are withdrawn.
    Watchman, let your wanderings cease;
    Hasten to your quiet home.
    Traveler, lo, the Prince of Peace,
    Lo, the Son of God is come!</lyrics>

    As I hear,
    Far and near,
    Sweetest angel voices:
    "Christ is born," their choirs are singing,
    Till the air,
    Everywhere,
    Now with joy is ringing.

2.  Hark! A voice from yonder manger,
    Soft and sweet,
    Does entreat:
    "Flee from woe and danger;
    Come and see; from all that grieves you
    You are freed;
    All you need
    I will surely give you."

3.  Come, then, let us hasten yonder;
    Here let all,
    Great and small,
    Kneel in awe and wonder;
    Love Him who with love is yearning;
    Hail the star 
    That from far
    Bright with hope is burning!</lyrics>

    Can He be the Savior?
    Ask the saved of all the race
    Who have found His favor.

2.  Angels sang about His birth,
    Wise men sought and found Him;
    Heaven's star shone brightly forth,
    Glory all around Him.
    Shepherds saw the wondrous sight,
    Heard the angels singing;
    All the plains were lit that night,
    All the hills were ringing.

3.  Gentle Mary laid her child
    Lowly in a manger;
    He is still the undefiled,
    But no more a stranger.
    Son of God, of humble birth,
    Beautiful the story;
    Praise His name in all the earth,
    Hail the King of glory!</lyrics>

    With love enough for all.
    While kingdoms slept, the Lord came down
    To grace a manger stall.
    And with a glorious light
    Angels appeared that night, 
    Singing, "Come, come, Christ is born!
    Come, come, world forlorn.
    The Child of peace and sacrifice is waiting to be found."

2.  Royalty and shepherds came
    To worship from afar,
    Guided through the long cold night
    By one persistent star.
    As each beheld the Son,
    Strangers became as one,
    Singing, "Come, come, Christ is born!
    Come, come, world forlorn.
    The Child of peace and sacrifice is waiting to be found."

3.  The mystery of Bethlehem
    Was long ago, they say,
    But, miracle of miracles,

    Love coming through the years,
    Singing, "Come, come, Christ is born!
    Come, come, world forlorn.
    The Child of peace and sacrifice is waiting to be found."</lyrics>

    Not yet was he to share our pain;
    But down the ages rings the cry
    Of those who saw their children die.

3.  Still rage the fires of hate today, 
    And innocents the price must pay, 
    While aching hearts in every land
    Cry out, "We cannot understand!"

4.  Lord Jesus, through our night of loss
    Shines out the wonder of your cross,
    The love that cannot cease to bear 
    Our human anguish everywhere.

5.  May that great love our lives control
    And conquer hate in every soul,
    Till, pledged to build and not destroy,
    We share your pain and find your joy.</lyrics>

    Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
    Snow on snow,
    In the bleak midwinter,
    Long ago.

2.  Our God, heaven cannot hold Him,
    Nor earth sustain;
    Heaven and earth shall flee away
    When He comes to reign:
    In the bleak midwinter
    A stable-place sufficed
    The Lord God incarnate,
    Jesus Christ.

3.  Angels and archangels
    May have gathered there,
    Cherubim and seraphim
    Thronged the air;
    But His mother only,
    In her maiden bliss,
    Worshiped the beloved
    With a kiss.

4.  What can I give Him,
    Poor as I am?
    If I were a shepherd,
    I would bring a lamb;
    If I were a wise man, 
    I would do my part;
    Yet what I can I give Him:
    Give my heart.</lyrics>

    That glorious song of old,
    From angels bending near the earth,
    To touch their harps of gold:
    "Peace on the earth, good will to all,
    From heaven's all gracious King":
    The world in solemn stillness lay,
    To hear the angels sing.

2.  Still through the cloven skies they come,
    With peaceful wings unfurled,
    And still their heavenly music floats
    O'er all the weary world:
    Above its sad and lowly plains
    They bend on hovering wing,
    And ever o'er its Babel sounds
    The blessed angels sing.

3.  And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
    Whose forms are bending low,
    Who toil along the climbing way
    With painful steps and slow,
    Look now! for glad and golden hours
    Come swiftly on the wing:
    O rest beside the weary road,
    And hear the angels sing.

4.  For lo, the days are hastening on,
    By prophet bards foretold,
    When with the ever-circling years
    Comes round the age of gold;
    When peace shall over all the earth
    Its ancient splendors fling,
    And the whole world give back the song
    Which now the angels sing.</lyrics>

    Repeat the sounding joy,

    Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

3.  No more let sins and sorrows grow,
    Nor thorns infest the ground;
    He comes to make His blessings flow
    Far as the curse is found,
    Far as the curse is found,
    Far as, far as the curse is found.

4.  He rules the world with truth and grace,
    And makes the nations prove
    The glories of His righteousness,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders, wonders of His love.</lyrics>

    How still we see thee lie!
    Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
    The silent stars go by.
    Yet in thy dark streets shineth
    The everlasting light;
    The hopes and fears of all the years
    Are met in thee tonight.

2.  For Christ is born of Mary;
    And gathered all above,
    While mortals sleep, the angels keep
    Their watch of wondering love.
    O morning stars, together
    Proclaim the holy birth!
    And praises sing to God the King,
    And peace to all on earth.

3.  How silently, how silently,
    The wondrous gift is given!
    So God imparts to human hearts
    The blessings of His heaven.
    No ear may hear His coming,
    But in this world of sin,
    Where meek souls will receive Him, still
    The dear Christ enters in.

4.  O holy Child of Bethlehem,
    Descend to us, we pray;
    Cast out our sin and enter in,
    Be born in us today.
    We hear the Christmas angels
    The great glad tidings tell;
    O come to us, abide with us,

      <lyrics>1.  Once in royal David's city
    Stood a lowly cattle shed,
    Where a mother laid her baby
    In a manger for His bed.
    Mary was that mother mild,
    Jesus Christ her little child.

2.  He came down to earth from heaven
    Who is God and Lord of all,
    And His shelter was a stable,
    And His cradle was a stall.
    With the poor, oppressed, and lowly,
    Lived on earth our Savior holy.

3.  Jesus is our childhood's pattern,
    Day by day like us He grew;
    He was little, weak and helpless,
    Tears and smiles like us He knew;
    And He feels for all our sadness,
    And He shares in all our gladness.

4.  And our eyes at last shall see Him, 
    Through His own redeeming love,
    For that Child so dear and gentle
    Is our Lord in heaven above;
    And He leads His children on
    To the place where He is gone.</lyrics>

    Silent and pure, wondrous light!
    What tidings brings it Israel?
    Can we new hope in it find?

    Come, let us go to Bethlehem;
    Follow the star, seeking Him.
    Let us adore and worship still,
    In love and joy to grow.

    When Christ our Lord was born on Christmas night.
    Venite adoremus Dominum.
    Venite adoremus Dominum.

Refrain:
    Venite adoremus Dominum.
    Venite adoremus Dominum.

2.  "Twas gentle Mary maid, so young and strong,
    Who welcomed here the Christ-child with a song.
    She laid Him in a stall at Bethlehem;
    The ass and oxen shared the roof with them.
    (Refrain)

3.  Saint Joseph too was by to tend the Child,
    To guard Him, and protect His mother mild.
    The angels hovered round and sang this song:
    Venite adoremus Dominum.
    (Refrain)

4.  And thus that manger poor became a throne;
    For He whom Mary bore was God the Son.
    O come, then, let us join the heavenly host;
    To praise the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

      <lyrics>1.  'Twas in the moon of wintertime,
    When all the birds had fled,
    That mighty Gitchi Manitou
    Sent angel choirs instead.
    Before their light the stars grew dim
    And wondering hunters heard the hymn:
    Jesus, your King, is born,
    Jesus is born.
    In excelsis gloria.

2.  Within a lodge of broken bark
    The tender Babe was found;
    A ragged robe of rabbit skin
    Enwrapped His beauty round.
    The chiefs from far before Him knelt
    With gifts of fox and beaver pelt:
    Jesus, your King, is born,
    Jesus is born.
    In excelsis gloria.

3.  O children of the forest free,
    O you of Manitou,
    The Holy Child of earth and heaven
    Is born today for you.
    Come kneel before the radiant boy
    Who brings you beauty, peace, and joy.
    Jesus, your King, is born,
    Jesus is born. 
    In excelsis gloria.</lyrics>

    Him whom heaven and earth adore;
    So may we with willing feet
    Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

3.  As they offered gifts most rare
    At that manger rude and bare;
    So may we with holy joy,
    Pure, and free from sin's alloy,
    All our costliest treasures bring,
    Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.

4.  Holy Jesus, every day
    Keep us in the narrow way;
    And, when earthly things are past,
    Bring our ransomed souls at last
    Where they need no star to guide,
    Where no clouds Thy glory hide.</lyrics>

    Bethlehem in slumber lies;
    Glistening heaven sends forth great light,
    Shepherds see a wondrous sight!
    Angel ranks in chorus sing,
    Silken sounds from heaven ring, 
    Frightened shepherds hear them say:
    "Christ comes down to earth today!"
    Glory be to God on high,
    Blest are all beneath the sky.

2.  Midnight slumber lies o'er all;
    One lone bright lamp lights the stall.
    Choose old clothing, wrap Him warmly,
    Manger shall His cradle be.
    Born to save us from our sin,
    Word made flesh, our lives to win,
    Came to earth from heaven's throne,
    Mortals' sin to bear alone.
    Glory be to God on high,
    Blest are all beneath the sky.

3.  Wise men long foretold the way,
    Saw the strange star's shining ray,
    Knew a child was born in Jewry,
    Worship would be joy for aye!
    Took strong camels hurrying,
    Crossing desert sought their King,
    Reverently to Him present
    Gold and myrrh and frankincense.
    Glory be to God on high,
    Blest are all beneath the sky.</lyrics>

    Maker and Monarch and Savior of all!

3.  Shall we then yield Him, in costly devotion,
    Odors of Edom and offerings divine,
    Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean,
    Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?

      <lyrics>1.  Lord, when You came to Jordan
    And asked to be baptized, 
    What was Your vow and vision
    Of love and sacrifice?
    Was there a sudden splendor
    Of prophets, priests, and kings,
    A wind that stirred the waters,
    A blur of mighty wings?

2.  Was this God's crowning moment
    Of all You had become,
    The Spirit's power and blessing:
    "Go now, You are My Son"?
    Did scripture join with scripture
    In words of sharp surprise:
    "The Lord's Messiah shall conquer,
    Rejected and despised"?

3.  Faith rests content with questions 
    Of when and why and how,
    But craves the gift of seeing
    What God is doing now.
    Lord, bring us to our Jordan
    Of newly opened eyes,
    Through love, immersed in living,
    As You were once baptized.</lyrics>

    Our utmost woe and loss;
    For us and our salvation
    To die upon the cross.

    On him, the Holy One,
    The hidden years had ended,
    The age of grace begun.</lyrics>

    Moses and Elijah vanish;
    Christ alone commands the height!
    Peter, James, and John fall silent,
    Turning from the summit's rise
    Downward toward the shadowed valley
    Where their Lord has fixed His eyes.

2.  Glimpsed and gone the revelation,
    They shall gain and keep its truth,
    Not by building on the mountain
    Any shrine or sacred booth,
    But by following the Savior
    Through the valley to the cross
    And by testing faith's resilience
    Through betrayal, pain, and loss.

3.  Lord, transfigure our perception
    With the purest light that shines,
    And recast our life's intentions 
    To the shape of Your designs,
    Till we seek no other glory
    Than what lies past Calvary's hill
    And our living and our dying
    And our rising by Your will.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  O wondrous sight, O vision fair
    Of glory that the church shall share,
    Which Christ upon the mountain shows,
    Where brighter than the sun He glows!

2.  From age to age the tale declare,
    How with the three disciples there,
    Where Moses and Elijah meet,
    The Lord holds converse high and sweet.

3.  The law and prophets there have place,
    Two chosen witnesses of grace;
    The Father's voice from out the cloud
    Proclaims His only Son aloud.

4.  With shining face and bright array
    Christ deigns to manifest today
    What glory shall be theirs above
    Who joy in God with perfect love.

5.  And faithful hearts are raised on high
    By this great vision's mystery,
    For which in joyful strains we raise
    The voice of prayer, the hymn of praise.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  My song is love unknown,
    My Savior's love to me,
    Love to the loveless shown
    That they might lovely be.
    O who am I 
    That for my sake
    My Lord should take 
    Frail flesh, and die?

2.  Christ came from heaven's throne
    Salvation to bestow,
    But people scorned and none
    The longed-for Christ would know.
    But O my Friend,
    My Friend indeed,
    Who at my need His life did spend!

3.  Sometimes they strew His way,
    And His sweet praises sing,
    Resounding all the way
    Hosannas to their King.
    Then "Crucify!"
    Is all their breath,
    And for His death 
    They thirst and cry.

4.  They rise, and needs will have
    My dear Lord made away;
    A murderer they save,
    The Prince of life they slay.
    Yet steadfast He
    To suffering goes,
    That He His foes 
    From thence might free.

5.  Here might I stay and sing,
    No story so divine:
    Never was love, dear King,
    Never was grief like Thine.
    This is my Friend,
    In whose sweet praise
    I all my days
    Could gladly spend.</lyrics>

    And from worldly joys abstain,
    Fasting with unceasing prayer,
    Strong with You to suffer pain?

3.  Then if Satan on us press,
    Flesh or spirit to assail,
    Victor in the wilderness,
    Grant that we not faint nor fail!

4.  So shall we have peace divine:
    Holier gladness ours shall be;
    Round us, too, shall angels shine,
    Such as served You faithfully.

    Ever constant by Your side;

2.  Was it for sins that I have done    
    He suffered on the tree?    
    Amazing pity! Grace unknown!    
    And love beyond degree!

3.  Well might the sun in darkness hide,     
    And shut its glories in,    
    When Christ, the great Redeemer, died    
    For human creatures' sin.

4.  But drops of grief can ne'er repay

2.  For us baptized, for us He bore

    For us temptations sharp He knew,
    For us the tempter overthrew.

3.  For us to evil power betrayed,
    Scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,
    He bore the shameful cross and death,
    For us gave up His dying breath.

4.  For us He rose from death again;
    For us He went on high to reign;
    For us He sent the Spirit here
    To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

      <lyrics>1.  Go to dark Gethsemane,
    All who feel the tempter's power;
    Your Redeemer's conflict see,
    Watch with Him one bitter hour;
    Turn not from His griefs away,
    Learn from Jesus Christ to pray.

2.  Follow to the judgment hall;
    View the Lord of life arraigned;
    O the wormwood and the gall!
    O the pangs His soul sustained!
    Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
    Learn from Christ to bear the cross.

3.  Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
    There, adoring at His feet,
    Mark the miracle of time,
    God's own sacrifice complete;
    "It is finished!" hear Him cry;
    Learn from Jesus Christ to die.

4.  Early hasten to the tomb
    Where they laid His breathless clay:
    All is solitude and gloom.
    Who has taken Him away?
    Christ is risen! He meets our eyes.
    Savior, teach us so to rise.</lyrics>

    O sacred head, what glory,
    What bliss till now was Thine!
    Yet, though despised and gory,
    I joy to call Thee mine.

2.  What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered
    Was all for sinners' gain:
    Mine, mine was the transgression,
    But Thine the deadly pain.
    Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
    'Tis I deserve Thy place;
    Look on me with Thy favor,
    Vouch-safe to me Thy grace.

3.  What language shall I borrow 
    To thank Thee, dearest friend,
    For this Thy dying sorrow,
    Thy pity without end?
    O make me Thine forever;
    And should I fainting be,
    Lord, let me never, never 
    Out-live my love to Thee.</lyrics>

    Lamb of God, Your grief I see.
    Darkness veils Your anguished face;
    None its lines of woe can trace.
    None can tell what pangs unknown
    Hold You silent and alone--

2.  Silent through those three dread hours,
    Wrestling with the evil powers,
    Left alone with human sin,
    Gloom around You and within,
    Till the appointed time is nigh,
    Till the Lamb of God may die.

3.  Hark, that cry that peals aloud
    Upward through the whelming cloud!
    You, the Father's only Son,
    You, His own anointed one,
    You are asking--can it be--
    "Why have You forsaken Me?"

4.  Lord, should fear and anguish roll,
    Flooding o'er my sinful soul, 
    You, who once were thus bereft
    That Your own might ne'er be left,
    Teach me by that bitter cry
    In the gloom to know You nigh.</lyrics>

    On cruel Calvary,
    As on the cross He bled
    In bitter agony.
    But they whom sin has wounded sore
    Find healing in the wounds He bore.

2.  He suffered shame and scorn
    And wretched, dire disgrace;
    Forsaken and forlorn,
    He hung there in our place.
    But all who would from sin be free
    Look to His cross for victory.

3.  His life, His all, He gave
    When He was crucified;
    Our burdened souls to save,
    What fearful death He died!
    But each of us, though dead in sin,
    Through Christ eternal life may win.</lyrics>

    Healing leaves of grace abounding
    Bring a taste of love unknown.

    From the caverns of despair.
    Walk with gladness in the morning.
    See what love can do and dare.
    Drink the wine of resurrection,
    Not a servant, but a friend.
    Jesus is our strong companion.
    Joy and peace shall never end.

3.  Christ is risen! Earth and heaven
    Nevermore shall be the same.
    Break the bread of new creation
    Where the world is still in pain.

2.  If the Lord had never risen,
    We'd have nothing to believe.
    But His promise can be trusted:
    "You will live, because I live."
    As we share the death of Adam,
    So in Christ we live again.
    Death has lost its sting and terror.
    Christ the Lord has come to reign.

3.  Death has lost its old dominion,
    Let the world rejoice and shout!
    Christ, the firstborn of the living,
    Gives us life and leads us out.
    Let us thank our God who causes
    Hope to spring up from the ground.
    Christ is risen, Christ is giving
    Life eternal, life profound.

    Earth, tell it out abroad;
    The Passover of gladness,

    From death to life eternal,
    From this world to the sky,
    Our Christ hath brought us over
    With hymns of victory.

2.  Our hearts be pure from evil,
    That we may see aright
    The Lord in rays eternal
    Of resurrection light;
    And, listening to His accents,
    May hear, so calm and plain,
    His own "All hail!" and, hearing,
    May raise the victor strain.

3.  Now let the heavens be joyful,
    Let earth the song begin,
    Let the round world keep triumph,
    And all that is therein;
    Let all things seen and unseen
    Their notes of gladness blend,
    For Christ the Lord is risen,
    Our joy that hath no end.</lyrics>

    Quite early in the day,
    A band of Christ's disciples,
    To worship, sing, and pray.
    A mighty wind came blowing,
    Filled all the swirling air,
    And tongues of fire aglowing
    Inspired each person there.

2.  The people all around them 
    Were startled and amazed
    To understand their language,
    As Christ the Lord they praised.
    What universal message,
    What great good news was here?
    That Christ, once dead, is risen
    To vanquish all our fear.

3.  God pours the Holy Spirit
    On all who would believe,
    On women, men, and children
    Who would God's grace receive.
    That Spirit knows no limit,
    Bestowing life and power.
    The church, formed and reforming,
    Responds in every hour.

4.  O Spirit, sent from heaven
    On that day long ago,
    Rekindle faith among us
    In all life's ebb and flow.
    O give us ears to listen
    And tongues aflame with praise,
    So folk of every nation
    Glad songs of joy shall raise.</lyrics>

2.  We would raise our alleluias
    For the grace of yester-years;
    For tomorrow's unknown pathway,
    Hear, O Lord, our humble prayers.
    In the church's pilgrim journey
    You have led us all the way,
    Still in presence move before us,
    Fire by night and cloud by day.

3.  Come, O Spirit, dwell among us;
    Give us words of fire and flame.
    Help our feeble lips to praise You,
    Glorify Your holy name.

    Three in one: what mystery!

      <lyrics>1.  Come, great God of all the ages,
    Make Your earthly mission known;
    Speak through every deed and person,
    Let Your way and will be shown.
    Guide the church to true commitment,
    Give direction now, we ask;
    Fit us for the work of building,
    Dedicate us to the task.

2.  Come, Christ Jesus, flesh and spirit,
    Sure foundation, cornerstone,
    Help us form the church eternal,
    May Your vision be our own.
    Send a message to each follower,
    Lead all people to Your way;
    Urge us to strong faith and action
    As we build the church today.

3.  Come, great Spirit, in and with us,
    Tune our ears to hear Your call;
    Through the moving of Your presence,
    Let redeeming love recall
    Ministry in dedication,
    Love embodied in our deeds;
    Challenge us to do Your bidding,
    See Your purpose, fill all needs.

4.  Come, O come, in celebration,
    Household of the one true God,
    In commitment and rejoicing
    Let us go where Christ has trod;
    As we act in faith and reverence,
    Let us, Lord, the future see;
    Place us in the church triumphant,
    Now and for eternity.</lyrics>

2.  O Lamb of God, Lord Jesus Christ,
    Whom God the Father gave us,
    Who for the world was sacrificed
    Upon the cross to save us;
    And as You sit at God's right hand
    And we for judgment there must stand,
    Have mercy, Lord, upon us.

3.  You only are the Holy One,
    Who came for our salvation,
    And only You are God's true Son,
    Who was before creation.
    You only, Christ, as Lord we own
    And with the Spirit, You alone
    Share in the Father's glory.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  God is One, unique and holy,
    Endless dance of love and light;
    Only source of mind and body,
    Star-cloud, atom, day and night:
    Everything that is or could be
    Tells God's anguish and delight.

2.  God is Oneness by communion,
    Never single or alone;
    All togetherness, including
    Friendship, family, and home,
    Common mind and shared agreement,
    Common loaf and sung shalom.

3.  God is One through desolation:
    Blindness, treason, blood and gall;
    One, though torn by separation
    In the Christ's forsaken call;
    One through death and resurrection;
    One in Spirit, One for all.</lyrics>

    Ground of being, life and love;
    Height and depth beyond description
    Only life in You can prove:
    You are mortal life's dependence:
    Thought, speech, sight are ours by grace;
    Yours is every hour's existence,
    Sovereign Lord of time and space.

2.  Jesus Christ, the One for others,
    We, Your people, make our prayer:
    Help us love as sisters, brothers, 
    All whose burdens we can share.
    Where Your name binds us together, 
    You, Lord Christ, will surely be;
    Where no selfishness can sever,
    There Your love the world may see.

3.  Holy Spirit, rushing, burning
    Wind and flame of Pentecost,
    Fire our hearts afresh with yearning
    To regain what we have lost.
    May Your love unite our action.
    Nevermore to speak alone:
    God, in us abolish faction,
    God, through us Your love make known.</lyrics>

    From the lips of sinners,
    Unto whom He came,
    Faithfully He bore it
    Spotless to the last,
    Brought it back victorious,
    When from death He passed;

3.  Bore it up triumphant,
    With its human light,
    Through all ranks of creatures,
    To the central height,
    To the throne of Godhead, 
    To the Father's breast;
    Filled it with the glory 
    Of that perfect rest.

4.  Christians, this Lord Jesus
    Shall return again,
    With His Father's glory
    O'er the earth to reign;
    For all wreaths of empire
    Meet upon His brow,
    And our hearts confess Him
    King of glory now.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Crown Him with many crowns,
    The Lamb upon His throne;
    Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns
    All music but its own!
    Awake, my soul, and sing
    Of Him who died for thee,
    And hail Him as thy matchless King
    Through all eternity.

2.  Crown Him the Lord of love;
    Behold His hands and side,
    Rich wounds, yet visible above,
    In beauty glorified:
    No angel in the sky
    Can fully bear that sight,
    But downward bends his burning eye
    At mysteries so bright.

3.  Crown Him the Lord of peace;
    Whose power a scepter sways
    From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
    Absorbed in prayer and praise:
    His reign shall know no end;
    And round His pierced feet
    Fair flowers of Paradise extend
    Their fragrance ever sweet.

4.  Crown Him the Lord of years,
    The Potentate of time;
    Creator of the rolling spheres,
    Ineffably sublime.
    All hail, Redeemer, hail!
    For Thou hast died for me;
    Thy praise shall never, never fail
    Throughout eternity.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Earth's scattered isles and contoured hills
    Which part the seas and mold the land,
    And vistas newly seen from space
    That show a world awesome and grand,
    All wondrously unite to sing:
    Take heart, take hope, the Lord is King!

2.  God's judgment passed on social ills
    That thwart awhile divine intent,
    The flagging dreams of weary folk
    Whose brave new world lies torn and rent,
    In painful form their message bring:
    Take heart, take hope, the Lord is King!

3.  The constant care which Israel knew
    Alike in faith and faithlessness,
    The subtle providence which guides 
    A pilgrim church through change and stress,
    Inspire us gratefully to sing:
    Take heart, take hope, the Lord is King!

4.  The light which shines through noble acts, 
    The quest for truth dispelling lies,
    The grace of Christ renewed in us
    So love lives on and discord dies,
    All blend their song, good news to bring:
    Take heart, take hope, the Lord is King!</lyrics>

(He is) King of kings,
He is Lord of lords,
Jesus Christ, the first and last,
No one works like Him.
O He is

He built His throne up in the air,
No one works like Him,
And called His saints from everywhere,
No one works like Him.
O He is King of kings,
He is Lord of lords,
Jesus Christ, the first and last,
No one works like Him.

He pitched His tents on Canaan ground,
No one works like Him,
And broke oppressive kingdoms down,
No one works like Him.
O He is King of kings,
Lord of lords,
Jesus Christ, the first and last,
No one works like Him.

I know that my Redeemer loves,
No one works like Him.
And by His love sweet blessing gives,
No one works like Him.
O He is King of kings,
He is Lord of lords,
Jesus Christ, the first and last,
No one works like Him.</lyrics>

    You gave up Your throne in God's glory

    In sunshine and storm here You stay;
    You patiently walk close beside us
    To comfort and help us each day;
    From You nothing ever can sever,
    We'll follow You now and forever.

3.  O what can we give You, Lord Jesus,
    For all you have done and still do?
    Is serving You here all that matters?
    Or saying we love only You?
    Yours only, to You consecrated,
    Our lives, Lord, are now dedicated;
    Dear Lord, we rejoice,
    Yes Lord, we rejoice in You.


1.  Jesús es mi Rey soberano,
    Mi gozo es cantar su loor;
    Es Rey, y me ve cual hermano,
    Es Rey y me imparte su amor.
    Dejando su trono de gloria,
    Me vino a sacar de la escoria, 
    Y yo soy feliz,
    Y yo soy feliz por El.

2.  Jesús es mi amigo anhelado, 
    Y en sombras o en luz siempre va
    Paciente y humilde a mi lado,
    Y ayuda y socorro me da.
    Por eso constante lo sigo,
    Porque El es mi Rey y mi amigo,
    Y yo soy feliz,
    Y yo soy feliz por El.

3.  Señor, ¿qué pudiera yo darte
    Por tanta bondad para mí?
    ¿Me basta servirte y amarte?
    ¿Es todo entregarme yo a Ti?
    Entonces acepta mi vida,
    Que a Ti sólo queda rendida,
    Pues yo soy feliz,
    Pues yo soy feliz por Ti.</lyrics>

    Who does not stand with wicked ones,
    And shuns the scorners' seat.

2.  How blest the one who in God's law
    Finds goodness and delight,
    And meditates upon that law
    With gladness day and night.

3.  That one is nourished like a tree
    Set by the river's side;
    Its leaf is green, its fruit is sure:
    The works of such abide.

4.  The wicked, like the driven chaff,
    Are swept from off the land;
    They shall not gather with the just,
    Nor at the judgment stand.

5.  The Lord will guard the righteous well,
    Their way to God is known;
    The way of sinners, far from God,
    Shall surely be o'erthrown.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Why are nations raging
    And conspiring plots in vain?
    Rulers of the world rise up,
    Weaving webs of death and pain.
    Then against the Lord they cry,
    And against God's holy Son,
    "Let us tear their bonds from us
    And with their control be done."

2.  But the Lord has scorn on them,
    Laughing and enthroned on high.
    God brings wrath upon their work;
    Filled with anger God replies:
    "It is My own holy will 
    That the Christ on earth shall reign,
    And on Zion's holy hill,
    My anointed I'll maintain."

3.  God's decree unto the King
    Tells us what the Lord did say:
    "You are My own holy child;
    I've begotten You this day.
    Ask of Me and I will make
    All the nations Your own stay.
    These possessions You shall rule,
    Strong as iron smashing clay."

4.  Therefore, leaders of the earth,
    Serve the Lord with holy fear;
    Trembling come before the throne
    Or God's anger will appear.
    Kiss God's feet in trembling awe
    Or the Lord will use the rod,
    Making beggars of all kings.
    Blest are those who trust in God.</lyrics>

    Wisdom for all to hold.
    The statutes of the Lord are just
    And give the heart delight;
    God's precepts are direct and pure
    And give the eyes clear sight.

2.  The fear of God is always clean,
    Enduring as the sun;
    The judgments of the Lord are true
    And righteous, every one.
    And even more to be desired
    Than gold, the finest gold,
    And sweeter than the honeycomb,
    The words God spoke of old.

3.  Your servant finds enlightenment 
    By means of them, O Lord;
    And in the keeping of Your law,
    There is a great reward.
    But who can tell how often they
    Offend unknowingly?
    From all my secret faults, O Lord,
    I ask You to cleanse me.

4.  Lord, keep me from presumptuous sins;
    Let them not rule my soul;
    Then I shall not commit great wrongs,
    I shall be sound and whole.
    Let all my words and all my thoughts,
    My Lord, Redeemer, Might,
    Find favor now, and always win
    Acceptance in Your sight.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Lord, why have You forsaken me,
    And why are You so far away
    From my complaint and my distress
    Poured out before You night and day?

2.  Yet You are holy, and the songs
    Of praise of Israel are Your throne;
    When our ancestors called on You,
    You saved them, rescued all Your own.

3.  But I am mocked and put to scorn,
    All those who see me laugh and say,
    "You trust in God, so let us see
    The help of God to whom you pray."

4.  Yet You, O Lord, have been my God
    And only hope since I was born;
    Trouble is near me, none can help;
    My Savior, leave me not forlorn.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  In the day of need may your answer be the Lord,
    May the God of Jacob strengthen you;
    May our Lord send help from the high and holy place,
    And support you for the glory of God's name.

2.  May the Lord God grant you success in all your plans,
    May God give you all your heart's desire;
    May we sing for joy when we see the battle won;
    When the Lord has heard and answered every prayer.

3.  Now I know the Lord will encourage all beloved,
    God will hear and answer from on high;
    Not a word shall fail of the promises once made,
    Nor the words of God's victorious right hand.

4.  There are some who boast of the weapons of the world,
    But the power of God is all our pride;
    Those who live by war shall one day collapse and fall,
    But God's people stand and in God's reign prevail.</lyrics>

    He makes me down to lie 
    In pastures green; He leadeth me 
    The quiet waters by.

2.  My soul He doth restore again;
    And me to walk doth make
    Within the paths of righteousness,
    E'en for His own name's sake.

3.  Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
    Yet will I fear none ill;
    For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
    And staff me comfort still.

4.  My table Thou hast furnished
    In presence of my foes;
    My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
    And my cup overflows.

5.  Goodness and mercy all my life
    Shall surely follow me;
    And in God's house forevermore
    My dwelling place shall be.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  The King of love my Shepherd is,
    Whose goodness faileth never;
    I nothing lack if I am His
    And He is mine forever.

2.  Where streams of living water flow
    My ransomed soul He leadeth, 
    And where the verdant pastures grow,
    With food celestial feedeth.

3.  Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
    But yet in love He sought me,
    And on His shoulder gently laid,
    And home, rejoicing, brought me.

4.  In death's dark vale I fear no ill
    With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
    Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
    Thy cross before to guide me.

5.  Thou spreadest a table in my sight;
    Thy unction grace bestoweth;
    And O what transport of delight
    From Thy pure chalice floweth!

6.  And so through all the length of days 
    Thy goodness faileth never;
    Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
    Within Thy house forever.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  My Shepherd will supply my need;
    Jehovah is His name:
    In pastures fresh He makes me feed,
    Beside the living stream.
    He brings my wandering spirit back,
    When I forsake His ways;
    And leads me, for His mercy's sake,
    In paths of truth and grace.

2.  When I walk through the shades of death
    You presence is my stay;
    One word of Your supporting breath
    Drives all my fears away.
    Your hand, in sight of all my foes,
    Does still my table spread;
    My cup with blessings overflows,
    Your oil anoints my head.

3.  The sure provisions of my God 
    Attend me all my days;
    O may Your House be my abode,
    And all my work be praise.
    There would I find a settled rest,
    While others go and come;
    No more a stranger, or a guest,
    But like a child at home.</lyrics>

    How good You've been to me.
    I said that this is my own work,

    But when You turned aside Your face,
    My life was filled with fears.
    I begged for help, to You I cried
    With loud and bitter tears.

3.  What good is gained by my disgrace,
    What profit in defeat?
    My grave cannot confess Your name,
    Nor praise for You repeat.
    Now hear, O Lord, my plaintive cry;
    Be merciful to me.
    Accept my longing heart's request
    And from death set me free.

4.  You change my grief to joy-filled dance,
    My sorrows You destroy.
    In faithfulness You hear my cry
    And fill my life with joy.
    And so to You my heart shall sing,
    My voice Your goodness raise.
    You are my God, forevermore,
    My life shall sing Your praise.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  How blest are those whose great sin
    Has freely been forgiven.
    Whose guilt is wholly covered
    Before the sight of heaven.
    Blest those to whom our Lord God
    Will not impute their sin,
    Whose guilt has been forgiven,
    Whose heart is true again.

2.  While I kept guilty silence,
    My strength was spent with grief.
    Your hand was heavy on me;
    My life found no relief.
    But when I made confession
    And hid no sin from You,
    When I revealed my own guilt,
    You gave me life anew.

3.  So let the godly seek You,
    When troubling times are near;
    No storm or flood shall reach them,
    Nor cause their hearts to fear.
    In You, O Lord, I hide me,
    You save me from all ill,
    And songs of Your salvation
    My heart with rapture fill.

4.  "I graciously will teach you
    The way that you should go,
    And with My eye upon you,
    My counsel you shall know.
    But be not then unruly,
    Or slow to understand;
    Be not perverse, but willing
    To heed My wise command."

5.  The sorrows of the wicked 
    In number shall abound,
    But those who trust our own God
    Great mercy shall surround.
    Then in the Lord be joyful,
    In song lift up your voice;
    Be glad in God, you righteous;
    Rejoice, O saints, rejoice.</lyrics>

3.  With the abundance of Thy house

4.  The fountain of eternal life
    Is found alone with Thee.
    And in the brightness of Thy light

5.  From those that know Thee may Thy love

    Taste and see, taste and see the goodness of the Lord.

1.  Fear the Lord, you holy ones,
    And your needs will be supplied;
    The young lions go empty and hungry,
    But believers want for nothing.

2.  Come, my children, and listen:
    I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
    Which of you delights in life,
    And desires long life to enjoy all things?

3.  Then your tongue must not speak evil,
    Nor your lips say lying words.
    Turn from evil, practice good,
    Seek peace and pursue it.
    (Refrain)

4.  The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
    The ears of God hear their cry;
    The face of the Lord is turned from the wicked,
    To wipe their remembrance from the earth.

5.  The righteous cry out and God hears,
    They are delivered from their distress.
    God is near to the brokenhearted,
    And saves the crushed in spirit.
    (Refrain)

6.  Though misfortunes of the good abound,
    They are delivered from them all;
    They keep all their bones,
    Not one is broken.

7.  Their own evil brings death to the wicked,
    And those who hate good will be brought to ruin.
    The Lord ransoms the souls of the servants,
    And none will be condemned who trust in God.

    You come to break oppression,

    Upon the fruitful earth,
    And love, joy, hope, like flowers,

    And righteousness in fountains
    From hill to valley flow.

3.  All rulers bow before You, 
    And gold and incense bring;
    All nations shall adore You,
    Your praise all people sing;
    To You shall prayer unceasing 
    And daily vows ascend;
    Your rule is still increasing,
    Your rule is without end.

4.  O'er every foe victorious,
    You on Your throne shall rest;
    From age to age more glorious,
    All blessing and all blest:
    The tide of time shall never

    Your name shall stand forever,
    Your changeless name of love.</lyrics>

    We're born, we live, but pass unseen.

3.  Our years are but three-score and ten,
    With special health they reach four-score.
    But still they're filled with pain and sin,
    Soon gone, and then we live no more.

4.  So teach us how to count our days,
    That wisdom might fill all our time.
    Return, O Lord, accept our praise,
    That through our lives Your love may shine.

5.  Establish, Lord, the work we do,
    And through it make Your glory known,
    That praise may ever come to You,
    And unto all Your love be shown.</lyrics>

    so far He removes our transgréssions from us.

13. As a father has compassion for his chìldren,

    Lord my God, You have such might.
    Cloaked with honor, grand and glorious,
    You are clothed with purest light.
    Stretching out the heavens like tent cloth,
    You are chambered on the deep.
    Riding on the wings of windstorm,
    Flame and fire Your bidding keep.

2.  Lord, You laid the earth's foundation
    That it would be always sound.
    By the word of Your commanding,
    You set forth each ocean's bound.
    Springs gush forth at Your own bidding,
    Giving drink to every field.
    Bird and beast and all Your creatures
    In that coolness find thirst healed.

3.  Grass You cause to grow for cattle,
    Plants for us to cultivate.
    Food You bring forth from our labor,
    Wine for joy and bread for plate.
    Trees You give the birds for shelter, 
    Mountain rock and cave for beast.
    Sun and moon both mark the seasons,
    In their light we work and feast.

4.  Lord, how great are all Your workings,
    Wisdom marks them through and through.
    All the earth is Your possession,
    Great and small belong to You.
    Food You give in each due season,
    At Your hand come all good things.
    By Your Spirit You create us;
    Lord, Your breath renewal brings.

5.  May Your glory reign forever.
    Lord, rejoice in all You make!
    As You look on Your creation,
    Mountains smoke, foundations shake.
    May these words and thoughts be pleasing,
    For in You my joy is found.
    Bless the Lord, my soul and being!
    With this song let praise abound.</lyrics>

    Blest is Your name, O living Lord.
    From this time forth and evermore,
    O'er all the world from shore to shore,
    O may Your name be long adored.
    You, Lord, are ruler of all lands;
    The works of states are in Your hands.
    There is no other like You, God;
    Your power is great, Your love is broad.
    All people live within Your power.
    Sing praise in this and every hour.

2.  You help the needy in distress,
    And give them life that conquers death,
    The great and small for You are one.
    You grant the homeless sheltered space,
    And empty people feel Your grace,
    That in all times Your will is done.
    I'll praise the Lord with all my breath,
    And trust my Maker unto death.
    Praise to the one who brings us life,
    And holds us safe in every strife.
    For God has conquered and is King;
    Eternal One, to You we sing.</lyrics>

    If that the Lord had not with us remained
    When cruel foes against us rose to strive,
    We surely had been swallowed up alive.

2.  Yea, when their wrath against us fiercely rose,
    The swelling tide had o'er us spread its wave,
    The raging stream had then become our grave,
    The surging flood, in proudly swelling roll,
    Most surely then had overwhelmed our soul.

3.  Blest be the Lord, who made us not their prey;
    As from the snare a bird escapeth free,
    Their net is rent and so escaped are we;
    Our only help is in God's holy name,
    Who made the earth and all the heavenly frame.</lyrics>

    And so they sang for joy,

      <lyrics>1.  Out of the depths to Thee I raise
    The voice of lamentation;
    Lord, turn a gracious ear to me,
    And hear my supplication.
    If Thou shouldst count our every sin,
    Each evil deed or thought within,
    O who could stand before Thee?

2.  To wash away the crimson stain
    Grace, grace alone prevaileth.
    Our works, alas! are all in vain;
    In much the best life faileth.
    For none can glory in Thy sight,
    All must alike confess Thy might
    And live alone by mercy.

3.  Therefore my trust is in the Lord,
    And not in mine own merit.
    On God my soul shall rest; God's word
    Upholds my fainting spirit.
    God's promised mercy is my fort,
    My comfort, and my strong support;
    I wait for it with patience.

4.  What though I wait the live-long night,
    And till the dawn appeareth,
    My heart still trusteth in God's might;
    It doubteth not nor feareth:
    So let the Israelites in heart,
    Born of the Spirit, do their part,
    And wait till God appeareth.</lyrics>

3.  All kings on earth who hear Your words,

    And from Your presence where, Lord, shall I fly?
    If I ascend to heaven You are there,
    And still are with me if in hell I lie.

3.  If I should take my flight into the dawn,
    If I should dwell on ocean's farthest shore,
    Your mighty hand will rest upon me still,
    And Your right hand will guard me evermore.

4.  If I should say, "Let darkness cover me,
    And I shall hide within the veil of night,"
    Surely the darkness is not dark to You:
    The night is as the day, the darkness light.

5.  Search me, O God, search me and know my heart;
    Try me, O God, my mind and spirit try;
    Keep me from any path that gives You pain,
    And lead me in the everlasting way.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  A mighty fortress is our God,
    A bulwark never failing;
    Our helper He amid the flood
    Of mortal ills prevailing.
    For still our ancient foe
    Doth seek to work us woe;
    His craft and power are great,
    And armed with cruel hate,
    On earth is not his equal.

2.  Did we in our own strength confide,
    Our striving would be losing;
    Were not the right Man on our side,
    The Man of God's own choosing.
    Dost ask who that may be?
    Christ Jesus, it is He,
    Lord Sabaoth His name,
    From age to age the same,
    And He must win the battle.

3.  And though this world, with devils filled,
    Schould threaten to undo us,
    We will not fear, for God hath willed
    His truth to triumph through us.
    The prince of darkness grim,
    We tremble not for him;
    His rage we can endure,
    For lo! his doom is sure,
    One little word shall fell him.

4.  That word above all earthly powers,
    No thanks to them, abideth;
    The Spirit and the gifts are ours
    Through Him who with us sideth;
    Let goods and kindred go,
    This mortal life also;
    The body they may kill,
    God's truth abideth still,
    His kingdom is forever.</lyrics>

    Wisdom and strength for each day do Thou send us,
    Patience untiring and courage unfailing.

2.  Wandering and lost, Thou hast sought us and found us,
    Stilled our rude hearts with Thy word of consoling;
    Wrap now Thy peace, like a mantle, around us,
    Guarding our thoughts and our passions controlling.

3.  How shall we stray, with Thy hand to direct us,

    Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,

2.  Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,

    Thy justice like mountains high soaring above
    Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

3.  To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small;
    In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
    We blossom and flourish like leaves on the tree,
    Then wither and perish; but naught changeth Thee.

    In faith and love, through centuries of wrong,
    Borne witness to the truth in every tongue:
    Alleluia!

    Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise!
    And may God give us faith to sing always:

2.  We have ventured worlds undreamed of

    Yielding unimagined power,
    Facing us with life's destruction
    Or our most triumphant hour.

3.  As each far horizon beckons,
    May it challenge us anew:
    Children of creative purpose,
    Serving others, honoring You.
    May our dreams prove rich with promise,
    Each endeavor well begun;
    Great Creator, give us guidance
    Till our goals and Yours are one.</lyrics>

    Though we, who fain would find Thee,
    Have tried, with thoughts uncouth,
    In feeble words to bind Thee,
    It is because Thou art
    We're driven to the quest;
    Till truth from falsehood part,
    Our souls can find no rest.

3.  All beauty speaks of Thee:
    The mountains and the rivers,
    The line of lifted sea,
    Where spreading moonlight quivers,
    The deep-toned organ blast
    That rolls through arches dim,
    Hints of the music vast
    Of Thine eternal hymn.

4.  Thou hidden fount of love,
    Of peace, and truth, and beauty,
    Inspire us from above 
    With joy and strength for duty;
    May Thy fresh light arise 
    Within each clouded heart,
    And give us open eyes

      <lyrics>1.  Lord of our growing years,
    With us from infancy,
    Laughter and quick-dried tears,
    Freshness and energy;
    Your grace surrounds us all our days;
    For all Your gifts we bring our praise.

2.  Lord of our strongest years,
    Stretching our youthful powers,
    Lovers and pioneers
    When all the world seems ours:
    Your grace surrounds us all our days;
    For all Your gifts we bring our praise.

3.  Lord of our middle years,
    Giver of steadfastness,
    Courage that perseveres
    When there is small success:
    Your grace surrounds us all our days;
    For all Your gifts we bring our praise.

4.  Lord of our older years,
    Steep though the road may be,
    Rid us of foolish fears,
    Bring us serenity:
    Your grace surrounds us all our days;
    For all Your gifts we bring our praise.

5.  Lord of our closing years,
    Always Your promise stands;
    Hold us, when death appears,
    Safely within Your hands:
    Your grace surrounds us all our days;
    For all Your gifts we bring our praise.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
    That saved a wretch like me!
    I once was lost, but now am found,
    Was blind, but now I see.

2.  'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    And grace my fears relieved;
    How precious did that grace appear
    The hour I first believed!

3.  Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
    I have already come;
    'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
    And grace will lead me home.

4.  The Lord has promised good to me,
    His word my hope secures;
    He will my shield and portion be
    As long as life endures.

5.  When we've been there ten thousand years,
    Bright shining as the sun,
    We've no less days to sing God's praise
    Than when we'd first begun.

    Pilgrim through this barren land;
    I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
    Hold me with Thy powerful hand;
    Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,
    Feed me till I want no more,
    Feed me till I want no more.

2.  Open now the crystal fountain,
    Whence the healing stream doth flow;
    Let the fire and cloudy pillar 
    Lead me all my journey through;
    Strong deliverer, strong deliverer,
    Be Thou still my strength and shield,
    Be Thou still my strength and shield.

3.  When I tread the verge of Jordan,
    Bid my anxious fears subside;
    Death of death, and hell's destruction,
    Land me safe on Canaan's side;
    Songs of praises, songs of praises
    I will ever give to Thee,
    I will ever give to Thee.</lyrics>

    With hopeful heart through all thy ways,
    God will give strength, whate'er betide thee,
    To bear thee through the evil days.
    Who trusts in God's unchanging love
    Builds on the rock that nought can move.

2.  Only be still, and wait God's leisure
    In cheerful hope, with heart content
    To take whate'er thy Keeper's pleasure
    And all discerning love hath sent.
    No doubt our inmost wants are clear
    To One who holds us always dear.

3.  Sing, pray, and swerve not from God's ways,
    But do thine own part faithfully;
    Trust the rich promises of grace,
    So shall they be fulfilled in thee.
    God never yet forsook at need
    The soul secured by trust indeed.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  God marked a line and told the sea
    Its surging tides and waves were free
    To travel up the sloping strand
    But not to overtake the land.

2.  God set one limit in the glade
    Where tempting, fruited branches swayed,
    And that first limit stands behind
    The limits that the law defined.

3.  The line, the limit, and the law
    Are patterns meant to help us draw
    A bound between what life requires
    And all the things our heart desires.

4.  But, discontent with finite powers,
    We reach to take what is not ours
    And then defend our claim by force
    And swerve from life's intended course.

5.  We are not free when we're confined
    To every wish that sweeps the mind,
    But free when freely we accept
    The sacred bounds that must be kept.</lyrics>

    Your holy will abiding;

    And follow where You are guiding.
    You are my God; 
    Though dark my road,
    You hold me that I shall not fall;
    Wherefore to You I leave it all.

2.  O God, what You ordain is right;
    You never will deceive me.
    You lead me by the proper path;
    I know You will not leave me.
    And take, content, 
    What You have sent;
    Your hand can turn my griefs away,
    And patiently I wait Your day.

3.  O God, what You ordain is right;
    Here shall my stand be taken.
    Though sorrow, need, or death be mine,
    Yet I am not forsaken.
    Your watchful care
    Is round me there;
    You hold me that I shall not fall,
    And so to You I leave it all.</lyrics>

    Mold the mountains, fashion blossoms,
    Call forth sunshine, wind, and rain.
    We, created in Your image,
    Would a true reflection be
    Of Your justice, grace, and mercy
    And the truth that makes us free.

2.  You have called us to be faithful
    In our life and ministry.
    We respond in grateful worship
    Joined in one community.
    When we blur Your gracious image,
    Focus us and make us whole.
    Healed and strengthened as Your people,
    We move onward toward Your goal.

3.  God, Your word is still creating,
    Calling us to life made new.
    Now reveal to us fresh vistas
    Where there's work to dare and do.
    Keep us clear of all distortion.
    Polish us with loving care.
    Thus, new creatures in Your image,
    We'll proclaim Christ everywhere.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  God folds the mountains out of rock
    And fuses elemental powers
    In ores and atoms we unlock
    To claim as if their wealth were ours.
    From veins of stone we lift up fire,
    And too impressed by our own skill
    We use the flame that we acquire,
    Not thinking of the Maker's will.

2.  Our instruments can probe and sound
    The folded mountain's potent core,
    But wisdom's ways are never found
    Among the lodes of buried ore, 
    Yet wisdom is the greater need,
    And wisdom is the greater source,
    For lacking wisdom we proceed
    To waste God's other gifts on force.

3.  Lord, grant us what we cannot mine,
    What science cannot plumb or chart:
    Your wisdom and your truth divine
    Enfolded in a faithful heart.
    Then we like mountains richly veined
    Will be a source of light and flame
    Whose energies have been ordained
    To glorify the Maker's name.</lyrics>

    That made the mountains rise;
    That spread the flowing seas abroad
    And built the lofty skies.
    I sing the wisdom that ordained
    The sun to rule the day;
    The moon shines full at God's command,
    And all the stars obey.

2.  I sing the goodness of the Lord
    That filled the earth with food;
    God formed the creatures with a word
    And then pronounced them good.
    Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed,
    Where'er I turn my eyes;
    If I survey the ground I tread,
    Or gaze upon the skies!

3.  There's not a plant or flower below
    But makes Thy glories known;
    And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
    By order from Thy throne;
    While all that borrows life from Thee
    Is ever in Thy care,
    And everywhere that we can be,
    Thou, God, art present there.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  O God of every nation,
    Of every race and land,
    Redeem the whole creation
    With Your almighty hand;
    Where hate and fear divide us
    And bitter threats are hurled,
    In love and mercy guide us
    And heal our strife-torn world.

2.  From search for wealth and power
    And scorn of truth and right,
    From trust in bombs that shower
    Destruction through the night,
    From pride of race and station
    And blindness to Your way,
    Deliver every nation,
    Eternal God, we pray.

3.  Lord, strengthen those who labor
    That all may find release
    From fear of rattling saber,
    From dread of war's increase;
    When hope and courage falter,
    Your still small voice be heard;
    With faith that none can alter,
    Your servants undergird.

4.  Keep bright in us the vision
    Of days when war shall cease,
    When hatred and division
    Give way to love and peace,
    Till dawns the morning glorious
    When peace on earth shall reign
    And Christ shall rule victorious
    O'er all the world's domain.</lyrics>

    All our needs that love await;

2.  From all that terror teaches,
    From lies of pen and voice,
    From all the easy speeches
    That make our hearts rejoice,
    From sale and profanation
    Of honor and the sword,
    From sleep and from damnation,
    Deliver us, good Lord!

3.  Awaken us to action
    And forge us into one,
    Defying sect and faction;
    O God, Your will be done!
    Oppressive systems snare us;
    Our apathies increase.
    Great God, in mercy spare us
    For justice and for peace!</lyrics>

    The crystal of the snow;
    Hath sent the hoary frost of heaven,
    The flowing waters sealed,
    And laid a silent loveliness 
    On hill and wood and field.

2.  O'er white expanses sparkling pure
    The radiant morns unfold;
    The solemn splendors of the night
    Burn brighter through the cold;
    Life mounts in every throbbing vein,
    Love deepens round the hearth,
    And clearer sounds the angel hymn,
    "Good will to all on earth."

3.  O Thou from whose unfathomed law
    The year in beauty flows,
    Thyself the vision passing by

    In ever-changing words of light,
    The wonder of Thy name.</lyrics>

    Christ's resurrection has freed us.

1.  Mira allá en el Calvario 
    en la roca hay una cruz;
    muerte que engendra la vida, 
    nuevos hombres, nueva luz,
    Cristo nos ha salvado con su 
    muerte y ressurrección.
    Todas las cosas renacen 
    en la nueva creación.
    (Estribillo)

2.  Cristo toma en su cuerpo 
    el pecado, la esclavitud.
    Al destruirlos, nos trae 
    una nueva plenitud,
    pone en paz a los hombres, 
    a las cosas y al Creador.
    Todo renace a la vida 
    en la nueva creación.
    (Estribillo)

3.  Cielo y tierra se abrazan, 
    nuestra alma haya el perdon.
    Vuelven a abrirse los cielos 
    para el hombre pecador.
    Israel peregrino, 
    vive y canta tu redención.
    Hay nuevos mundos abiertos 
    en la nueva creación.

      <lyrics>1.  O Lord of every shining constellation
    That wheels in splendor through the midnight sky,
    Grant us Your Spirit's true illumination
    To read the secrets of Your work on high.

2.  You, Lord, have made the atom's hidden forces,
    Your laws its mighty energies fulfill;
    Teach us, to whom You give such rich resources,
    In all we use, to serve Your holy will.

3.  You, Lord, have stamped Your image on Your creatures,
    And though they mar that image, love them still;
    Lift up our eyes to Christ, that in His features
    We may discern the beauty of Your will.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  There's a wideness in God's mercy,
    Like the wideness of the sea;
    There's a kindness in God's justice,
    Which is more than liberty.
    There is no place where earth's sorrows
    Are more felt than up in heaven;
    There is no place where earth's failings
    Have such kindly judgment given.

2.  For the love of God is broader
    Than the measures of the mind;
    And the heart of the Eternal
    Is most wonderfully kind.
    If our love were but more faithful,
    We would gladly trust God's Word;
    And our lives reflect thanksgiving
    For the goodness of our Lord.</lyrics>

    And I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,
    And I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth;
    At Bethlehem I had My birth.

Refrain:
    Dance, then, wherever you may be;
    I am the Lord of the Dance, said He,
    And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
    And I'll lead you all in the dance, said He.

2.  I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,
    But they would not dance and they would not follow Me;
    I danced for the fishermen, for James and John;
    They came with Me and the dance went on.
    (Refrain)

3.  I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame;
    The holy people said it was a shame.
    They whipped and they stripped and they hung Me high,
    And left Me there on a cross to die.
    (Refrain)

4.  I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black;
    It's hard to dance with the devil on your back.
    They buried My body and they thought I'd gone:
    But I am the dance and I still go on.
    (Refrain)

5.  They cut Me down and I leap up high;
    I am the life that will never, never die;
    I'll live in you if you'll live in Me:
    I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

    Let me to Thy bosom fly,
    While the nearer waters roll,
    While the tempest still is high:
    Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
    Till the storm of life is past;
    Safe into the haven guide;
    O receive my soul at last!

2.  Other refuge have I none;
    Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
    Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
    Still support and comfort me.
    All my trust on Thee is stayed,
    All my help from Thee I bring;
    Cover my defenseless head 
    With the shadow of Thy wing.

3.  Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
    More than all in Thee I find:
    Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
    Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
    Just and holy is Thy name;
    I am all unrighteousness;
    False and full of sin I am,
    Thou art full of truth and grace.

4.  Plenteous grace with Thee is found, 
    Grace to cover all my sin;
    Let the healing streams abound;
    Make and keep me pure within.
    Thou of life the fountain art,
    Freely let me take of Thee;
    Spring Thou up within my heart,
    Rise to all eternity.</lyrics>

    You, the carpenter of Nazareth,
    Toiling for Your daily food,
    By Your patience and Your courage
    You have taught us work is good.

2.  Where the many toil together,
    There You are among Your own;
    Where the solitary labor,
    You are there with them alone.
    You, the peace that passes knowledge,
    Dwelling in the daily strife;
    You, the Bread of heaven, are broken
    In the sacrament of life.</lyrics>

    The light that shone on Bethlehem
    Fills all the world today;
    Of Jesus' birth and peace on earth
    The angels sing alway.

2.  O sing a song of Nazareth,
    Of sunny days of joy,
    O sing of fragrant flowers' breath,
    And of the sinless Boy:
    For now the flowers of Nazareth
    In every heart may grow;
    Now spreads the fame of His dear name
    On all the winds that blow.

3.  O sing a song of Galilee,
    Of lake and woods and hill,
    Of Him who walked upon the sea
    And bade its waves be still:
    For though, like waves on Galilee,
    Dark seas of trouble roll,
    When faith has heard the Master's word,
    Falls peace upon the soul.

4.  O sing a song of Calvary,
    Its glory and dismay;
    Of Him who hung upon the tree,
    And took our sins away:
    For He who died on Calvary
    Is risen from the grave,
    And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,
    Is mighty now to save.</lyrics>

2.  In millions alive, away and abroad;

    Imprisoned in systems, You long to be free.
    We see You, Lord Jesus, still bearing Your tree.

3.  We hear You, O Christ, in agony cry.
    For freedom You march, in riots You die.
    Your face in the papers we read and we see.
    The tree must be planted by human decree.

    To do and to endure.

3.  Breathe on me, Breath of God,
    Till I am wholly Thine,
    Until this earthly part of me
    Glows with Thy fire divine.

4.  Breathe on me, Breath of God,
    So shall I never die,
    But live with Thee the perfect life
    Of Thine eternity.*

      <lyrics>1.  Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness;
    Pierce the clouds of nature's night;
    Come, O source of joy and gladness,
    Breathe Your life, and spread Your light.
    From the height which knows no measure,
    As a gracious shower descend,
    Bringing down the richest treasure
    We can wish, or God can send.

2.  Author of the new creation,
    Come, anoint us with Your power.
    Make our hearts Your habitation;
    With Your grace our spirits shower.
    Hear, O hear our supplication,
    Blessed Spirit, God of peace!
    Rest upon this congregation
    With the fullness of Your grace.</lyrics>

    Taught by You, we covet most,
    Of Your gifts at Pentecost,
    Holy, heavenly love.

2.  Love is kind and suffers long;
    Love is meek and thinks no wrong;
    Love than death itself more strong;
    Therefore give us love.

3.  Prophecy will fade away,
    Melting in the light of day;
    Love will ever with us stay;
    Therefore give us love.

4.  Faith and hope and love we see,
    Joining hand in hand agree,
    But the greatest of the three,
    And the best, is love.</lyrics>

    Spirit, spirit of gentleness,
    Blow through the wilderness, calling and free,
    Spirit, spirit of restlessness,
    Stir me from placidness, 
    Wind, wind on the sea.

1.  You moved on the waters, 
    You called to the deep,
    Then You coaxed up the mountains 
    From the valleys of sleep,
    And over the eons
    You called to each thing,
    "Awake from your slumbers
    And rise on your wings."
    (Refrain)

2.  You swept through the desert,
    You stung with the sand,
    And You gifted your people
    With a law and a land,
    And when they were blinded
    With their idols and lies,
    Then You spoke through Your prophets
    To open their eyes.
    (Refrain)

3.  You sang in a stable,
    You cried from a hill,
    Then You whispered in silence
    When the whole world was still,
    And down in the city
    You called once again
    When You blew through Your people
    On the rush of the wind.
    (Refrain)

4.  You call from tomorrow,
    You break ancient schemes,
    From the bondage of sorrow
    The captives dream dreams;
    Our women see visions,
    Our men clear their eyes. 
    With bold new decisions
    Your people arise.

    Till, clouds and storms thus ended,

      <lyrics>1.  Deep in the shadows of the past,
    Far out from settled lands,
    Some nomads traveled with their God
    Across the desert sands.
    The dawn of hope for humankind
    Was glimpsed by them alone:
    A promise calling them ahead,
    A future yet unknown.

2.  While others bowed to changeless gods
    They met a mystery:
    God with an uncompleted name,
    "I am what I will be";
    And by their tents, around their fires,
    In story, song, and law
    They praised, remembered, handed on
    A past that promised more.

3.  From Abraham to Nazareth
    The promise changed and grew,
    While some, remembering the past,
    Recorded what they knew,
    And some, in letters or laments,
    In prophecy and praise,
    Recovered, held, and re-expressed
    New hope for changing days.

4.  For all the writings that survived,
    For leaders, long ago,
    Who sifted, chose, and then preserved
    The Bible that we know,
    Give thanks, and find its promise yet
    Our comfort, strength, and call,
    The working model for our faith,
    Alive with hope for all.</lyrics>

    Let my praise and worship start
    With the cleansing of my heart.

2.  Save me from the soothing sin
    Of the empty cultic deed
    And the pious, babbling din
    Of the claimed but unlived creed.
    Let my actions, Lord, express
    What my tongue and lips profess.

3.  When I bend upon my knees,
    Clasp my hands, or bow my head,
    Let my spoken, public pleas
    Be directly, simply said,
    Free of tangled words that mask
    What my soul would plainly ask.

4.  When I dance or chant Your praise,
    When I sing a psalm or hymn,
    When I preach Your loving ways,
    Let my heart add its Amen.
    Let each cherished outward rite
    Thus reflect Your inward light.</lyrics>

    And Your people shall go forth in joy.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
    Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art--
    Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
    Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

2.  Riches I heed not, nor vain, empty praise,
    Thou mine inheritance, now and always:
    Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
    Great God of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

3.  Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word;
    I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
    Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
    Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  By gracious powers so wonderfully sheltered,
    And confidently waiting, come what may,
    We know that God is with us night and morning
    And never fails to greet us each new day.

2.  Yet is this heart by its old foe tormented,
    Still evil days bring burdens hard to bear;
    O give our frightened souls the sure salvation
    For which, O Lord, You taught us to prepare.

3.  And when this cup You give is filled to brimming
    With bitter suffering, hard to understand,
    We take it thankfully and without trembling,
    Out of so good and so beloved a hand.

4.  Yet when again in this same world You give us
    The joy we had, the brightness of Your sun,
    We shall remember all the days we lived through,
    And our whole life shall then be Yours alone.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Called as partners in Christ's service,
    Called to ministries of grace,
    We respond with deep commitment
    Fresh new lines of faith to trace.
    May we learn the art of sharing,
    Side by side and friend with friend,
    Equal partners in our caring 
    To fulfill God's chosen end.

2.  Christ's example, Christ's inspiring,
    Christ's clear call to work and worth,
    Let us follow, never faltering,
    Reconciling folk on earth.
    Men and women, richer, poorer, 
    All God's people, young and old,
    Blending human skills together
    Gracious gifts from God unfold.

3.  Thus new patterns for Christ's mission,
    In a small or global sense,
    Help us bear each other's burdens,
    Breaking down each wall or fence.
    Words of comfort, words of vision,
    Words of challenge, said with care,
    Bring new power and strength for action,
    Make us colleagues, free and fair.

4.  So God grant us for tomorrow
    Ways to order human life
    That surround each person's sorrow
    With a calm that conquers strife.
    Make us partners in our living,
    Our compassion to increase,
    Messengers of faith, thus giving
    Hope and confidence and peace.</lyrics>

    Forgive our foolish ways;
    Reclothe us in our rightful mind,
    In purer lives Thy service find,
    In deeper reverence, praise.

2.  In simple trust like theirs who heard,
    Beside the Syrian sea,
    The gracious calling of the Lord,
    Let us, like them, without a word
    Rise up and follow Thee.

3.  O Sabbath rest by Galilee,
    O calm of hills above,
    Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee
    The silence of eternity,
    Interpreted by love!

4.  Drop Thy still dews of quietness,
    Till all our strivings cease;
    Take from our souls the strain and stress,
    And let our ordered lives confess
    The beauty of Thy peace.

5.  Breathe through the heats of our desire
    Thy coolness and Thy balm;
    Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
    Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
    O still, small voice of calm!

2.  Since we have been raised with You, Lord, 
    help keep our hearts and minds 
    Pure and set on things that build Your rule
    o'er all the earth.
    All our life is now hidden 
    with You in God.

    The unforgiving heart
    That broods on wrongs and will not let
    Old bitterness depart?

3.  In blazing light Your cross reveals
    The truth we dimly knew:
    What trivial debts are owed to us,
    How great our debt to You!

4.  Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls
    And bid resentment cease.
    Then, bound to all in bonds of love,
    Our lives will spread Your peace.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Let all who pray the prayer Christ taught
    First clear the cluttered heart.
    Make room to breathe the living thought
    Those well-worn words impart.

2.  Dismiss the fear that this world drifts
    With no one in command.
    Your pulse and breath are signs and gifts
    From God's attentive hand.

3.  Refine and test each passing aim
    Against this final one:
    Has your life hallowed heaven's name
    And has God's will been done?

4.  Discard each vengeful hope that's fed
    The dreams of wars you'll win,
    Then freely ask for daily bread
    And pardon from your sin.

5.  Examine how temptation breeds
    Inside the mind's dark maze,
    Acknowledging that your life needs
    Deliverance from its ways.

6.  By faithful discipline prepare
    An inward holy space
    That when you offer Jesus' prayer
    Your heart may fill with grace.</lyrics>

    A life that trusts in You.

3.  By Your divine and urgent claim,

    As we, by love, for love were made.
    Your living likeness still we bear,
    Though marred, dishonored, disobeyed.
    We come, with all our heart and mind
    Your call to hear, Your love to find.

2.  We come with self inflicted pains
    Of broken trust and chosen wrong,
    Half-free, half-bound by inner chains,
    By social forces swept along,
    By powers and systems close confined
    Yet seeking hope for humankind.

3.  Great God, in Christ You call our name
    And then receive us as Your own
    Not through some merit, right, or claim
    But by Your gracious love alone.
    We strain to glimpse Your mercy seat
    And find You kneeling at our feet.

4.  Then take the towel, and break the bread,
    And humble us, and call us friends.
    Suffer and serve till all are fed
    And show how grandly love intends
    To work till all creation sings,
    To fill all worlds, to crown all things.

5.  Great God, in Christ You set us free
    Your life to live, Your joy to share.
    Give us Your Spirit's liberty
    To turn from guilt and dull despair
    And offer all that faith can do
    While love is making all things new.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
    Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
    Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
    Call for songs of loudest praise.
    Teach me some melodious sonnet,
    Sung by flaming tongues above;
    Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
    Mount of God's unchanging love!

2.  Here I raise my Ebenezer,
    Hither by Thy help I'm come;
    And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
    Safely to arrive at home.
    Jesus sought me when a stranger,
    Wandering from the fold of God;
    He, to rescue me from danger,
    Interposed His precious blood.

3.  O to grace how great a debtor
    Daily I'm constrained to be!
    Let that grace now, like a fetter,
    Bind my wandering heart to Thee:
    Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
    Prone to leave the God I love;
    Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
    Seal it for Thy courts above.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  O Master, let me walk with Thee
    In lowly paths of service free;
    Tell me Thy secret; help me bear
    The strain of toil, the fret of care.

2.  Help me the slow of heart to move
    By some clear, winning word of love;
    Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
    And guide them in the homeward way.

3.  Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee
    In closer, dearer company,
    In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
    In trust that triumphs over wrong.

4.  In hope that sends a shining ray
    Far down the future's broadening way;
    In peace that only thou canst give,
    With Thee, O Master, let me live.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Help us accept each other
    As Christ accepted us;
    Teach us as sister, brother, 
    Each person to embrace.
    Be present, Lord, among us
    And bring us to believe
    We are ourselves accepted
    And meant to love and live.

2.  Teach us, O Lord, Your lessons,
    As in our daily life
    We struggle to be human
    And search for hope and faith.
    Teach us to care for people,
    For all, not just for some,
    To love them as we find them
    Or as they may become.

3.  Let Your acceptance change us,
    So that we may be moved
    In living situations
    To do the truth in love;
    To practice Your acceptance
    Until we know by heart
    The table of forgiveness
    And laughter's healing art.

4.  Lord, for today's encounters
    With all who are in need,
    Who hunger for acceptance,
    For righteousness and bread,
    We need new eyes for seeing,
    New hands for holding on:
    Renew us with Your Spirit;
    Lord, free us, make us one!

    Hear Thou the prayer I make
    On bended knee.
    This is my earnest plea:
    More love, O Christ, to Thee,
    More love to Thee, 
    More love to Thee!

2.  Once earthly joy I craved, 
    Sought peace and rest;
    Now Thee alone I seek,
    Give what is best.
    This all my prayer shall be:
    More love, O Christ, to Thee,
    More love to Thee, 
    More love to Thee!

3.  Then shall my latest breath
    Whisper Thy praise;
    This be the parting cry
    My heart shall raise.
    This still its prayer shall be:
    More love, O Christ, to Thee,
    More love to Thee,
    More love to Thee!</lyrics>

    Speak to our fearful hearts by conflict rent.
    Save us, Thy people, from consuming passion,
    Who by our own false hopes and aims are spent.

2.  Hope of the world, God's gift from highest heaven,
    Bringing to hungry souls the bread of life,
    Still let Thy Spirit unto us be given
    To heal earth's wounds and end our bitter strife.

3.  Hope of the world, afoot on dusty highways,
    Showing to wandering souls the path of light;
    Walk Thou beside us lest the tempting byways
    Lure us away from Thee to endless night.

4.  Hope of the world, who by Thy cross didst save us
    From death and deep despair, from sin and guilt;
    We render back the love Thy mercy gave us;
    Take Thou our lives and use them as Thou wilt.

5.  Hope of the world, O Christ, o'er death victorious,
    Who by this sign didst conquer grief and pain,
    We would be faithful to Thy gospel glorious:

      <lyrics>1.  How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
    Is laid for your faith in God's excellent Word!
    What more can be said than to you God hath said,
    To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

2.  "Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
    For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
    I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
    Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.

3.  "When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
    The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
    For I will be near thee, thy troubles to bless,
    And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

4.  "When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
    My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
    The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
    Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

5.  "The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
    I will not, I will not desert to its foes;
    That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
    I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake."</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  I sing a song of the saints of God,
    Patient and brave and true,
    Who toiled and fought and lived and died
    For the Lord they loved and knew.
    And one was a doctor, and one was a queen,
    And one was shepherdess on the green:
    They were all of them saints of God, and I mean,
    God helping, to be one too.

2.  They loved their Lord so dear, so dear,
    And God's love made them strong;
    And they followed the right, for Jesus' sake,
    The whole of their good lives long.
    And one was a soldier, and one was a priest, 
    And one was slain by a fierce wild beast:
    And there's not any reason, no, not the least,
    Why I shouldn't be one too.

3.  They lived not only in ages past, 
    There are hundreds of thousands still;
    The world is bright with the joyous saints
    Who love to do Jesus' will.
    You can meet them in school, or in lanes, or at sea,
    In church, or in trains, or in shops, or at tea;
    For the saints of God are just folk like me,
    And I mean to be one too.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Jesus, priceless treasure,
    Source of purest pleasure,
    Truest friend to me;
    Long my heart hath panted,
    Till it well-nigh fainted,
    Thirsting after Thee.
    Thine I am, O spotless Lamb,
    I will suffer nought to hide Thee,
    Ask for nought beside Thee.

2.  In Thine arm I rest me;
    Foes who would oppress me
    Cannot reach me here.
    Though the earth be shaking,
    Every heart be quaking,
    God dispels our fear;
    Sin and hell in conflict fell
    With their heaviest storms assail us:
    Jesus will not fail us.

3.  Hence, all thoughts of sadness!
    For the Lord of gladness,
    Jesus, enters in:
    Those who love the Father,
    Though the storms may gather,
    Still have peace within;
    Yea, whate'er we here must bear,
    Still in Thee lies purest pleasure,
    Jesus, priceless treasure!</lyrics>

    Myself to Thee entirely give.

2.  O grant that nothing in my soul
    May dwell, but Thy pure love alone;
    O may Thy love possess me whole,
    My joy, my treasure, and my crown!
    All coldness from my heart remove;
    May every act, word, thought be love.

3.  O Love, how gracious is Thy way!
    All fear before Thy presence flies;
    Care, anguish, sorrow melt away,
    Where'er Thy healing beams arise.
    O Jesus, nothing may I see,
    Nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Lonely the boat, sailing at sea, tossed on a cold, stormy
night;
    Cruel the sea which seemed so wide, with waves so high.
    This single ship sailed the deep sea, straight into the gale;
    O Lord, great is the peril, dangers do all assail.

2.  Strong winds arose in all their rage, tossing the tiny lone
boat;
    Waves billowing high, tossing the boat, lost and afloat.
    The sailor stood all alone, wondering what to do;
    O Lord, so helpless was he, wondering what to do.

3.  Trembling with fear, deep in despair, looking for help all
around,
    The sailor saw light from above. "Help can be found;
    My God is here in my small boat, standing by my side;
    O I trust in the Savior; now in my life abide.

4.  "Pleading for Your mercy, O Lord, even a sinner like me;
    Command, O Lord, calm to the sea, as in Galilee!
    Please save my life from all danger, grant a peaceful life;
    O please be merciful, Lord, in times of calm and strife.

5.  "Storms in our lives, cruel and cold, surely will arise again,
    Threatening lives, threatening us on life's wild sea.
    Powerful and great, God's hand is there, firmly in control.
    O Lord, calm peace comes from You, peace comes to my lone soul."

2.  Where all is doubt, may we sow faith;
    Where all is gloom, may we sow hope;
    Where all is night, may we sow light;
    Where all is tears, may we sow joy.

3.   Jesus, our Lord, may we not seek 
    To be consoled, but to console,
    Nor look to understanding hearts,
    But look for hearts to understand.

4.  May we not look for love's return,
    But seek to love unselfishly,
    For in our giving we receive,
    And in forgiving are forgiven.

5.  Dying, we live, and are reborn
    Through death's dark night to endless day:
    Lord, make us servants of Your peace
    To wake at last in heaven's light.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Love divine, all loves excelling, 
    Joy of heaven, to earth come down,
    Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
    All Thy faithful mercies crown!
    Jesus, Thou art all compassion,
    Pure, unbounded love Thou art;
    Visit us with Thy salvation,
    Enter every trembling heart.

2.  Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit
    Into every troubled breast!
    Let us all in Thee inherit,
    Let us find the promised rest;
    Take away the love of sinning;
    Alpha and Omega be;
    End of faith, as its beginning,
    Set our hearts at liberty.

3.  Come, Almighty to deliver,
    Let us all Thy life receive;
    Suddenly return, and never,
    Nevermore Thy temples leave.
    Thee we would be always blessing,
    Serve Thee as Thy hosts above;
    Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing,
    Glory in Thy perfect love.

4.  Finish, then, Thy new creation;
    Pure and spotless let us be;
    Let us see Thy great salvation
    Perfectly restored in Thee;
    Changed from glory into glory,
    Till in heaven we take our place,
    Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
    Lost in wonder, love, and praise.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1. You have come up to the lakeshore,
    Looking neither for wise nor wealthy. 
    You only wanted that I should follow.

Refrain:
    O Lord, with Your eyes You have searched me,
    And, while smiling, have called out my name.
    Now my boat's left on the shoreline behind me,
    Now with You I will seek other seas.

2.  You know that I own so little,
    In my boat there's no money nor weapons,
    You'll only find there my nets and labor.
    (Refrain)

3.  You need the caring of my hands.
    Through my tiredness, may others find resting.
    You need a love that just goes on loving.
    (Refrain)

4.  You, who have fished other oceans,
    Ever longed for by souls that are waiting,
    My dear and good friend, as thus You call me.
    (Refrain)


1.  Tú has venido a la orilla,
    No has buscado ni a sabios ni a ricos,
    Tan sólo quieres que yo te siga.
    (Estribillo)

Estribillo:
    Señor, me has mirado a los ojos
    y sonriendo has dicho mi nombre;
    en la arena he dejado mi barca;
    junto a ti buscaré otro mar.


2.  Tú sabes bien lo que tengo:
    En mi barca no hay oro ni espadas,
    Tan sólo redes y mi trabajo.
    (Estribillo)

3.  Tu necesitas mis manos,
    Mi cansancio que a otros descanse,
    Amor que quiera seguir amando.
    (Estribillo)

4.  Tu pescador de otros mares,
    Ansia eterna de almas que esperan,
    Amigo bueno, que asi me llamas.

    And then I shall be free;

    And I shall conqueror be.

2.  I sink in life's alarms
    When by myself I stand;
    Imprison me within Thine arms,
    And strong shall be my hand.

3.  My heart is weak and poor 
    Until it master find;
    It has no spring of action sure.
    It varies with the wind.

4.  It cannot freely move
    Till Thou hast wrought its chain;
    Enslave it with Thy matchless love,
    And deathless it shall reign.

5.  My will is not my own
    Till Thou hast made it Thine;
    If it would reach a monarch's throne,
    It must its crown resign;

6.  It only stands unbent
    Amid the clashing strife,
    When on Thy bosom it has leant,
    And found in Thee its life.</lyrics>

2.  When darkness veils His lovely face,
    I rest on His unchanging grace;
    In every high and stormy gale,
    My anchor holds within the veil.
    (Refrain)

3.  His oath, His covenant, His blood

    How can we fail to be restored,
    When reached by love that never ends?

2.  From every ailment flesh endures
    Our bodies clamor to be freed;
    Yet in our hearts we would confess
    That wholeness is our deepest need.

3.  How strong, O Lord, are our desires,
    How weak our knowledge of ourselves!
    Release in us those healing truths
    Unconscious pride resists or shelves.

4.  In conflicts that destroy our health
    We recognize the world's disease;
    Our common life declares our ills:
    Is there no cure, O Christ, for these?

5.  Grant that we all, made one in faith,
    In Your community may find
    The wholeness that, enriching us,
    Shall reach the whole of humankind.</lyrics>

    O may my love to Thee
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,

    And griefs around me spread,

    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray

3.  O joy that seekest me through pain,

    Who stretched a living fabric on our frame
    And gave to each a language and a name.

2.  Where we are torn and pulled apart by hate
    Because our race, our skin is not the same;
    While we are judged unequal by the state
    And victims made because we own our name,

    Dishonored is Your living face on earth.

    Whose flesh and blood are ours, whatever skin,
    In His humanity we find our own,
    And in His family our proper kin:
    Christ is the brother we still crucify,
    His love the language we must learn, or die.</lyrics>

    Where anyone may kneel,
    I also come to ask for grace,
    Believing You can heal.

2.  If pain of body, stress of mind,
    Destroys my inward peace,
    In prayer for others may I find
    The secret of release.

3.  If self upon its sickness feeds
    And turns my life to gall,
    Let me not brood upon my needs,
    But simply tell You all.

4.  You never said, "You ask too much,"
    To any troubled soul.
    I long to feel Your healing touch;
    Will You not make me whole?

5.  But if the thing I most desire
    Is not Your way for me,
    May faith, when tested in the fire,
    Prove its integrity.

6.  Of all my prayers, may this be chief:
    Till faith is fully grown,
    Lord, disbelieve my unbelief,
    And claim me as Your own.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Take Thou our minds, dear Lord, we humbly pray;
    Give us the mind of Christ each passing day;
    Teach us to know the truth that sets us free;
    Grant us in all our thoughts to honor Thee.

2.  Take Thou our hearts, O Christ, they are Thine own;
    Come Thou within our souls and claim Thy throne;
    Help us to shed abroad Thy deathless love;
    Use us to make the earth like heaven above.

3.  Take Thou our wills, Most High! Hold Thou full sway;
    Have in our inmost souls Thy perfect way;
    Guard Thou each sacred hour from selfish ease;
    Guide Thou our ordered lives as Thou dost please.

4.  Take Thou ourselves, O Lord, heart, mind, and will;
    Through our surrendered souls Thy plans fulfill.
    We yield ourselves to Thee-- time, talents, all;
    We hear, and henceforth heed, Thy sovereign call.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Take up your cross, the Savior said,
    If you would My disciple be;
    Take up your cross with willing heart,
    And humbly follow after Me.

2.  Take up your cross, let not its weight
    Fill your weak spirit with alarm;
    Christ's strength shall bear your spirit up
    And brace your heart and nerve your arm.

3.  Take up your cross, heed not the shame,
    And let your foolish heart be still;
    The Lord for you accepted death
    Upon a cross, on Calvary's hill.

4.  Take up your cross, then, in Christ's strength,
    And calmly every danger brave:
    It guides you to abundant life
    And leads to victory o'er the grave.</lyrics>

1.  Señor, por tu clemencia,

    Te implora un pecador;

    Por la eternidad,
    Que agonizante fuiste,

    And cry, "My Lord and God!"

3.  Help then, O Lord, our unbelief;
    And may our faith abound
    To call on You when You are near
    And seek where You are found:

    In realms of clearer light
    We may behold You as You are,
    With full and endless sight.</lyrics>

    Good works of service are for offering.
    When we are giving, or when receiving,
    We belong to God, we belong to God.

3.  Mid times of sorrow and in times of pain,
    When sensing beauty or in love's embrace,
    Whether we suffer, or sing rejoicing,
    We belong to God, we belong to God.

4.  Across this wide world, we shall always find
    Those who are crying with no peace of mind,
    But when we help them, or when we feed them,
    We belong to God, we belong to God.

2.  En esta vida, frutos hemos de dar
    Las obras buenas son para ofrendar.

3.  En la tristeza y en el dolor,

    When will armies wage no war,
    Nations conquer not their neighbor,
    Weapons idle, used no more?
    When will guns and bombs be silent?
    When will captives be set free?
    All creation groans in longing
    For the world's true liberty.

2.  Floods and earthquakes, drought and famine
    Plague the world with awesome ill,
    But far greater is war's horror
    Caused by human, stubborn will.
    Blest are those who, working, praying,
    Purpose in their hearts to be 
    Instruments of peace, committed
    To the nations' harmony.

3.  As we strive for peace with vigor,
    Hoping to be shown the way,
    We are strengthened in the knowledge
    Of a future, perfect day;
    For we know that deeper, richer
    Peace is ours when Christ shall reign:
    Then will all our swords be plowshares
    And God's children free from pain.</lyrics>

    Everything to God in prayer!
    O what peace we often forfeit,
    O what needless pain we bear,
    All because we do not carry
    Everything to God in prayer!

2.  Have we trials and temptations?
    Is there trouble anywhere?
    We should never be discouraged:
    Take it to the Lord in prayer!
    Can we find a friend so faithful,
    Who will all our sorrows share?
    Jesus knows our every weakness;
    Take it to the Lord in prayer!

3.  Are we weak and heavy laden,
    Cumbered with a load of care?
    Precious Savior, still our refuge--
    Take it to the Lord in prayer!
    Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
    Take it to the Lord in prayer!
    In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
    Thou wilt find a solace there.

3.  From tender childhood's helplessness,
    From human grief and burdened toil,
    From famished souls, from sorrow's stress,
    Thy heart has never known recoil.

4.  The cup of water given for Thee
    Still holds the freshness of Thy grace;
    Yet long these multitudes to see
    The sweet compassion of Thy face.

5.  O Master, from the mountainside,
    Make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
    Among these restless throngs abide,
    O tread the city's streets again;

6.  Till all the world shall learn Thy love,

    Till glorious from Thy heaven above

    Lives of justice, truth, and love.
    Trust no other claim than those;
    Set your heart on things above.
    Soon the Lord will come in power,
    Burning clean the threshing floor:
    Then will flames the chaff devour;
    Wheat alone shall fill God's store."

3.  With such preaching stark and bold
    John proclaimed salvation near,
    And his timeless warnings hold
    Words of hope to all who hear.
    So we dare to journey on,
    Led by faith through ways untrod,
    Till we come at last like John
    To behold the Lamb of God.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  When I had not yet learned of Jesus Christ,
    When I refused to listen to God's call,
    I was defiant then, till God broke through;
    Now by God's grace Christ is my all in all.
    
2.  Whatever talent God has given me
    I pledge to use in service and in love.
    Joined with my God to lift my neighbor's load,
    New strength and hope are given from above.

3.  To be God's servant in this earthly life,
    No matter if the task is great or small,
    This is my charge: to witness faithfully,
    Strengthened by Christ who is my all in all.

    Both flower and flaming star,
    To whom there is no here nor there,
    No time, no near nor far,
    No alien race, no foreign shore,
    No child unsought, unknown:
    O send us forth, Thy prophets true,
    To make all lands Thine own!

2.  O God of love, whose Spirit wakes
    In every human breast,
    Whom love, and love alone, can know,
    In whom all hearts find rest:
    Help us to spread Thy gracious reign
    Till greed and hate shall cease,
    And kindness dwell in human hearts,
    And all the earth find peace!

3.  O God of truth, whom science seeks
    And reverent souls adore,
    Who lightest every earnest mind
    Of every clime and shore:
    Dispel the gloom of error's night,
    Of ignorance and fear,
    Until true wisdom from above
    Shall make life's pathway clear!

4.  O God of beauty, oft revealed
    In dreams of human art,
    In speech that flows to melody,
    In holiness of heart:
    Teach us to turn from sinfulness
    That shuts our hearts to Thee,
    Till all shall know the loveliness
    Of lives made fair and free!

5.  O God of righteousness and grace,
    Seen in the Christ, Thy Son,
    Whose life and death reveal Thy face,
    By whom Thy will was done:
    Inspire Thy heralds of good news
    To live Thy life divine,
    Till Christ is formed in every heart,
    And every land is Thine!</lyrics>

    Wasted work and wasted play,
    Call to mind the word of Jesus,

3.  For all days are days of judgment,
    And the Lord is waiting still,
    Drawing near a world that spurns Him,
    Offering peace from Calvary's hill.

    So we today our firstfruits bring,
    The wealth of this good land:

    Of mind and heart and hand.

2.  A world in need now summons us
    To labor, love, and give,
    To make our life an offering
    To God that all may live.
    The church of Christ is calling us 
    To make the dream come true:
    A world redeemed by Christ-like love,
    All life in Christ made new.

3.  With gratitude and humble trust
    We bring our best to You,
    Not just to serve Your cause,
    but share Your love with neighbors too.
    O God who gave Yourself to us 
    In Jesus Christ Your Son,
    Help us to give ourselves each day
    Until life's work is done.</lyrics>

    Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.
    The night draws nigh.

3.  Come, labor on.
    Away with gloomy doubts and faithless fear!
    No arm so weak but may do service here;
    Though feeble agents, may we all fulfill
    God's righteous will.

    That You are Lord of all
    And will not let us fall.

2.  But if, forgetful, we should find
    Your yoke is hard to bear,
    If worldly pressures fray the mind
    And love itself cannot unwind
    Its tangled skein of care:
    Our inward life repair.

3.  We mark Your saints, how they became
    In hindrances more sure,
    Whose joyful virtues put to shame
    The casual way we wear Your name,
    And by our faults obscure
    Your power to cleanse and cure.

4.  In what You give us, Lord, to do,
    Together or alone,
    In old routines or ventures new,
    May we not cease to look to You--
    The cross You hung upon--
    All You endeavored done.</lyrics>

    Free our hearts to faith and praise.
    Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
    For the living of these days,

3.  Cure Thy children's warring madness,
    Bend our pride to Thy control;

    Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
    Lest we miss Thy kingdom's goal,

4.  Set our feet on lofty places;
    Gird our lives that they may be
    Armored with all Christ-like graces,
    Pledged to set all captives free.
    Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
    That we fail not them nor Thee!
    That we fail not them nor Thee!

5.  Save us from weak resignation
    To the evils we deplore;
    Let the gift of Thy salvation
    Be our glory evermore.
    Grant us wisdom, grant us courage,
    Serving Thee whom we adore,

4.  For Christ alone, whose blood was shed,

    Until my very heart o'erflow
    In kindling thought and glowing word,
    Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

5.  O use me, Lord, use even me,
    Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where;
    Until Thy blessed face I see,
    Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Lord, whose love through humble service
    Bore the weight of human need,
    Who upon the cross, forsaken,
    Offered mercy's perfect deed,
    We, Your servants, bring the worship
    Not of voice alone, but heart,
    Consecrating to Your purpose
    Every gift that You impart.

2.  Still Your children wander homeless;
    Still the hungry cry for bread;
    Still the captives long for freedom;
    Still in grief we mourn our dead.
    As, O Lord, Your deep compassion
    Healed the sick and freed the soul,
    Use the love Your Spirit kindles
    Still to save and make us whole.

3.  As we worship, grant us vision,
    Till Your love's revealing light,
    In its height and depth and greatness,
    Dawns upon our quickened sight,
    Making known the needs and burdens
    Your compassion bids us bear,
    Stirring us to tireless striving,
    Your abundant life to share.

4.  Called from worship to Your service,
    Forth in Your dear name we go,
    To the child, the youth, the aged,
    Love in living deeds to show;
    Hope and health, goodwill and comfort,
    Counsel, aid, and peace we give,
    That Your servants, Lord, in freedom
    May Your mercy know and live.</lyrics>

    Whate'er the gift may be;
    All that we have is Thine alone,
    A trust, O Lord, from Thee.

2.  May we Thy bounties thus
    As stewards true receive,
    And gladly, as Thou blessest us,
    To Thee our firstfruits give.

3.  To comfort and to bless,
    To find a balm for woe,
    To tend the lonely in distress,
    Is angels' work below.

4.  The captive to release,
    To God the lost to bring,
    To teach the way of life and peace--
    It is a Christ-like thing.

5.  And we believe Thy Word,
    Though dim our faith may be;
    Whate'er for Thine we do, O Lord,
    We do it unto Thee.</lyrics>

    "Heal the sick and preach the word."
    Lest the church neglect its mission,
    And the gospel go unheard,
    Help us witness to your purpose
    With renewed integrity;
    With the Spirit's gifts empower us
    For the work of ministry.

2.  Lord, you call us to your service:
    "In my name baptize and teach."
    That the world may trust your promise,
    Life abundant meant for each,
    Give us all new fervor, draw us
    Closer in community;
    With the Spirit's gifts empower us
    For the work of ministry.

3.  Lord, you make the common holy:
    "This my body, this my blood."
    Let us all, for earth's true glory,
    Daily lift life heavenward,
    Asking that the world around us
    Share your children's liberty;
    With the Spirit's gifts empower us
    For the work of ministry.
    
4.  Lord, you show us love's true measure:
    "Father, what they do, forgive."
    Yet we hoard as private treasure
    All that you so freely give.
    May your care and mercy lead us 
    To a just society;
    With the Spirit's gifts empower us
    For the work of ministry.

5.  Lord, you bless with words assuring:
    "I am with you to the end."
    Faith and hope and love restoring,
    May we serve as you intend,
    And, amid the cares that claim us,
    Hold in mind eternity;
    With the Spirit's gifts empower us
    For the work of ministry.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  O Lord, You gave Your servant John
    A vision of the world to come:
    A radiant city filled with light,
    Where You with us will make Your home;
    Where neither grief nor pain shall dwell, 
    Since former things have passed away,
    And where they need no sun nor moon;
    Your glory lights eternal day.

2.  Our cities, Lord, wear shrouds of pain;
    Beneath our gleaming towers of wealth
    The homeless crouch in rain and snow,
    The poor cry out for strength and health.
    Youth's hope is dimmed by ignorance;
    Unwilling, workers idled stand;
    Indifference walks unheeding by
    As hunger stretches out its hand.

3.  Come, Lord, make real John's vision fair;
    Come, dwell with us, make all things new;
    We try in vain to save our world
    Unless our help shall come from You.
    Come, strengthen us to live in love;
    Bid hatred, greed, injustice cease.
    Your glory all the light we need,
    Let all our cities shine forth peace.</lyrics>

    Disciples of the Lord,
    To help to set the captive free,
    Make plowshare out of sword,
    To feed the hungry, quench their thirst,
    Make love and peace our fast,
    To serve the poor and homeless first,
    Our ease and comfort last.

2.  God made the world and at its birth
    Ordained our human race
    To live as stewards of the earth,
    Responding to God's grace.
    But we are vain and sadly proud,
    We sow not peace but strife,
    Our discord spreads a deadly cloud
    That threatens all of life.

3.  Pray justice may come rolling down
    As in a mighty stream,
    With righteousness in field and town
    To cleanse us and redeem.
    For God is longing to restore
    An earth where conflicts cease,
    A world that was created for 
    A harmony of peace.

4.  May we in service to our God
    Act out the living Word,
    And walk the road the saints have trod
    Till all have seen and heard.
    As stewards of the earth may we
    Give thanks in one accord
    To God who calls us all to be 
    Disciples of the Lord.</lyrics>

    Our lives the book our cities read
    To help them find Your way.
    O pour Your sovereign Spirit out

    Inspire Your church with love and power

    Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
    She is His new creation
    By water and the word;
    From heaven He came and sought her
    To be His holy bride;
    With His own blood He bought her,
    And for her life He died.
    
2.  Elect from every nation,
    Yet one o'er all the earth,
    Her charter of salvation
    One Lord, one faith, one birth;
    One holy name she blesses,
    Partakes one holy food,
    And to one hope she presses,
    With every grace endued.
    
3.  Though with a scornful wonder
    This world sees her oppressed,
    By schisms rent asunder,
    By heresies distressed,
    Yet saints their watch are keeping;
    Their cry goes up: "How long?"
    And soon the night of weeping
    Shall be the morn of song.
    
4.  Mid toil and tribulation,
    And tumult of her war,
    She waits the consummation
    Of peace forevermore;
    Till with the vision glorious
    Her longing eyes are blest,
    And the great church victorious
    Shall be the church at rest.
    
5.  Yet she on earth has union
    With God the Three in One,
    And mystic sweet communion
    With those whose rest is won:
    O happy ones and holy!
    Lord, give us grace that we,
    Like them, the meek and lowly,
    May live eternally.</lyrics>

    To keep the faith unbroken

2.  Baptized in one confession,
    One church in all the earth,
    We bear our Lord's impression,
    The sign of second birth:
    One holy people gathered
    In love beyond our own,
    By grace we were invited,
    By grace we make You known.

3.  Where tyrants' hold is tightened,
    Where strong devour the weak,
    Where innocents are frightened,
    The righteous fear to speak,
    There let Your church awaking
    Attack the powers of sin
    And, all their ramparts breaking,
    With You the victory win.

4.  This is the moment glorious 
    When He who once was dead
    Shall lead His church victorious,
    Their champion and their head.
    The Lord of all creation
    His heavenly kingdom brings,
    The final consummation,
    The glory of all things.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  We gather here to bid farewell
    To friends who leave for other parts;
    Our prayers we pledge, our love we tell,
    And lift to God our grateful hearts.

2.  We bless the hand that brought you here
    And richly blest us all in you:
    As now you leave for wider sphere
    God's covenant mercies we review.

3.  In friendship's bond our souls unite
    In prayer and praise and holy vow:
    To God's great heart of love and light
    Your kin in Christ commit you now.

4.  God guide you, keep you, lead you on
    From hope to hope, from strength to strength,
    Until, in God's all-glorious dawn,
    We meet before the throne at length.</lyrics>

1.  The chariot rode on the mountaintop,
    God's going to build up Zion's walls.
    My God spoke and the chariot did stop.
    God's going to build up Zion's walls.

    Oh, Great day!
    Great day, the righteous marching, Great day!
    God's going to build up Zion's walls.
2.  This is the day of Jubilee,
    God's going to build up Zion's walls.
    God shall set the people free.

      <lyrics>1.  Glorious things of thee are spoken,
    Zion, city of our God;
    God, whose word cannot be broken,
    Formed thee for a blest abode.
    On the rock of ages founded,
    What can shake thy sure repose?
    With salvation's walls surrounded,
    Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

2.  See, the streams of living waters,
    Springing from eternal love,
    Well supply thy sons and daughters
    And all fear of want remove.
    Who can faint while such a river
    Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
    Grace, which like the Lord the giver,
    Never fails from age to age.

3.  Round each habitation hovering,
    See the cloud and fire appear
    For a glory and a covering,
    Showing that the Lord in near.
    Thus deriving from their banner
    Light by night and shade by day,
    Safe they feed upon the manna
    Which God gives them when they pray.</lyrics>

2.  Then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb,
    Nor shall the fierce devour the small;
    As beasts and cattle calmly graze,
    A little child shall lead them all.
    Then enemies shall learn to love,
    All creatures find their true accord;

    In street and shop and tenement
    Wring gold from human pain,
    And bitter lips in blind despair
    Cry, "Christ has died in vain!"

3.  Give us, O God, the strength to build
    The city that has stood
    Too long a dream, whose laws are love,
    Whose ways are servanthood,
    And where the sun that shines becomes
    God's grace for human good.

4.  Already in the mind of God
    That city rises fair.
    Lo, how its splendor challenges
    The souls that greatly dare,
    And bids us seize the whole of life
    And build its glory there.</lyrics>

    Here, as bread and wine are taken,
    Christ sustains us as of old.
    Here the servants of the Servant
    Seek in worship to explore
    What it means in daily living
    To believe and to adore.

4.  Lord of all, of church and kingdom,
    In an age of change and doubt 
    Keep us faithful to the gospel,
    Help us work Your purpose out.
    Here, in this day's dedication,
    All we have to give, receive:
    We, who cannot live without You,
    We adore You!  We believe!</lyrics>

    Christ, the true, the only light,
    Sun of Righteousness, arise,
    Triumph o'er the shades of night;
    Dayspring from on high, be near;
    Daystar, in my heart appear.

2.  Dark and cheerless is the morn
    Unaccompanied by Thee;
    Joyless is the day's return
    Till Thy mercy's beams I see,
    Till they inward light impart,
    Cheer my eyes and warm my heart.

3.  Visit then this soul of mine;
    Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
    Fill me, radiancy divine;
    Scatter all my unbelief;
    More and more Thyself display,
    Shining to the perfect day.</lyrics>

    Joyful music leads us sunward

      <lyrics>1.  Here, O Lord, Your servants gather,
    Hand we link with hand;
    Looking toward our Savior's cross,
    Joined in love we stand.
    As we seek the realm of God,
    We unite to pray:
    Jesus, Savior, guide our steps,
    For You are the Way.

2.  Many are the tongues we speak,
    Scattered are the lands,
    Yet our hearts are one in God,
    One in love's demands.
    E'en in darkness hope appears,
    Calling age and youth:
    Jesus, teacher, dwell with us,
    For You are the Truth.

3.  Nature's secrets open wide,
    Changes never cease;
    Where, O where, can weary souls
    Find the source of peace?
    Unto all those sore distressed,
    Torn by endless strife:
    Jesus, healer, bring Your balm,
    For You are the Life.

4.  Grant, O God, an age renewed,
    Filled with deathless love;
    Help us as we work and pray,
    Send us from above
    Truth and courage, faith and power
    Needed in our strife:
    Jesus, Savior, be our way,
    Be our truth, our life.</lyrics>

3.  Christ breaks the power of reigning sin,

    Christ's blood can make the sinful clean,
    Christ's blood availed for me.

    And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
    When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
    And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;
    (Refrain)

3.  And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
    Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
    That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
    He bled and died to take away my sin;
    (Refrain)

4.  When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
    And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
    Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
    And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
    (Refrain)

    O day of joy and light,
    O balm of care and sadness,
    Most beautiful, most bright;
    This day the high and lowly,
    Through ages joined in tune,
    Sing "Holy, holy, holy"
    To the great God triune.

2.  This day at the creation
    The light first had its birth;
    This day for our salvation
    Christ rose from depths of earth;
    This day our Lord victorious 
    The Spirit sent from heaven,
    And thus this day most glorious
    A triple light was given.

3.  This day God's people, meeting,
    The Holy Scripture hear;
    Christ's living presence greeting,
    Through bread and wine made near.
    We journey on, believing,
    Renewed with heavenly might,
    From grace more grace receiving
    On this blest day of light.

4.  That light our hope sustaining,
    We walk the pilgrim way,
    At length our rest attaining,
    Our endless Sabbath day.
    We sing to You our praises,
    O Father, Spirit, Son;
    The church its voice upraises
    To You, blest Three in One.</lyrics>

    That laps at every shore
    With visions of a world at peace,
    No longer bled by war:

    Your cross has made us one!

6.  O praise the power, the truth, 
    The love, the word, the tide.
    Yet more than these, O praise their source,
    Praise Christ the crucified:
    We praise You, Christ!
    Your cross has made us one!

7.  O praise the living Christ
    With faith's bright songful voice!
    Announce the gospel to the world
    And with these words rejoice:
    We praise You, Christ!
    Your cross has made us one!</lyrics>

    O soul and body, join to raise

    The chariots of heaven the deep thunderclouds form,
    And bright is God's path on the wings of the storm.

3.  The earth with its store of wonders untold,
    Almighty, Thy power hath founded of old;
    Hath stablished it fast by a changeless decree,
    And round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.

4.  Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite?
    It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
    It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
    And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

5.  Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,

    Sing with hearts, sing with souls,
    Dance with joy to God,
    To whom we offer praises,
    To whom we sing with gladness.

1.  Let all our hearts open up to the Lord God,
    Let all the heavens hear how our hearts rejoice;
    For it is God who has given us graces,
    From whom comes the music in our voice.
    O Lord, we sing with joyful hearts,
    with soul and body offer we our arts.

2.  Let all our bodies sway to God's music,
    Let all the earth move with our feet and hands;
    For it is God who inspires and uplifts us,
    From whom flows all rhythm in our dance.
    O Lord, we sing with joyful hearts,
    with soul and body offer we our arts.

3.  Let all our souls shine out with God's beauty,
    Let all creation feel our love for God;
    For it is God who has granted us wisdom,
    In whom we find reality and dream.
    O Lord, we sing with joyful hearts, 
    with soul and body offer we our arts.</lyrics>

    So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
    Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
    And opened the life-gate that all may go in.

Refrain:
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    Let the earth hear His voice!
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    Let the people rejoice!
    O come to the Father through Jesus the Son,
    And give Him the glory: great things He hath done!

2.  Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
    And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
    But purer, and higher, and greater will be 
    Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.

      <lyrics>1.  When the morning stars together
    Their Creator's glory sang,
    And the angel host all shouted
    Till with joy the heavens rang,
    Then Your wisdom and Your greatness
    Their exultant music told,
    All the beauty and the splendor
    Which Your mighty works unfold.

2.  When in synagogue and temple
    Voices raised the psalmists' songs,
    Offering the adoration
    Which alone to You belongs,
    When the singers and the cymbals
    With the trumpet made accord,
    Glory filled the house of worship,
    And all knew Your presence, Lord.

3.  Voice and instrument in union
    Through the ages spoke Your praise,
    Plain-song, tuneful hymns, and anthems
    Told Your faithful, gracious ways.
    Choir and orchestra and organ
    Each a sacred offering brought,
    While, inspired by Your own Spirit,
    Poet and composer wrought.

4.  Lord, we bring our gift of music;
    Touch our lips and fire our hearts,
    Teach our minds and train our senses,
    Fit us for these sacred arts.
    Then with skill and consecration
    We would serve You, Lord, and give
    All our powers to glorify You,
    And in serving fully live.</lyrics>

    A solace here I find:
    May Jesus Christ be praised!
    Or fades my earthly bliss?
    My comfort still is this:
    May Jesus Christ be praised!

3.  Let earth's wide circle round
    In joyful notes resound:
    May Jesus Christ be praised!
    Let air and sea and sky
    From depth to height reply:
    May Jesus Christ be praised!

    Established is Your law,
    And changeless it shall stand,
    Deep writ upon the human heart,
    On sea, or land.

3.  You have eternal life
    Implanted in the soul;

    God created light and land,
    World of bird and beast and, later,
    In God's image, woman, man.
    There is water in the river
    Bringing life to tree and plant.
    Let creation praise its giver:
    There is water in the font.

2.  Water on the human forehead,
    Birthmark of the love of God,
    Is the sign of death and rising;
    Through the seas there runs a road.
    There is water in the river
    Bringing life to tree and plant.
    Let creation praise its giver:
    There is water in the font.

3.  Standing round the font reminds us
    Of the Hebrews' climb ashore.
    Life is hallowed by the knowledge:
    God has been this way before.
    There is water in the river
    Bringing life to tree and plant.
    Let creation praise its giver:
    There is water in the font.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  With grateful hearts our faith professing,
    We ask You, Lord, come to our aid,
    That we, our common faith confessing,
    May keep the vows that we have made.

2.  We know that in Your true providing
    The young and old to Christ belong;
    Lord, help us to be wise in guiding,
    And make us in example strong.

3.  Give to the parents love and patience,
    Each home with Christian graces fill.
    Protect our children in temptations,
    And keep them safe in childhood's ill.

4.  Accept, O Lord, our dedication
    To fill with love the growing mind,
    That in this church and congregation
    The young a faith for life may find.</lyrics>

    Baptized with the Spirit's sign, 
    With this water God has sealed you
    Unto love and grace divine.

2.  Child of love, our love's expression,
    Love's creation, loved indeed!
    Fresh from God, refresh our spirits,
    Into joy and laughter lead.

3.  Child of joy, our dearest treasure,
    God's you are, from God you came.
    Back to God we humbly give you:
    Live as one who bears Christ's name.

4.  Child of God, your loving Parent,
    Learn to listen for God's call.
    Grow to laugh and sing and worship,
    Trust and love God more than all.</lyrics>

    God's covenant with us is sealed.
    And long before we know or pray,
    God's love enfolds us every day.

2.  Here in this sacrament we see
    God's grace unbound, for all, for me!
    May we respond with joyful praise
    In loving service all our days.

3.  This child of God, though young or old,
    We welcome now into Christ's fold,
    To know with us God's loving care;
    Here all our joys and sorrows share.

4.  Now we our vow of faith renew,
    Stretch wide our sights to global view,
    And claim with Christians far and near
    A larger family held dear.</lyrics>

2.  We meet, as in that upper room they met,
    Thou at the table, blessing, yet dost stand;
    "This is My body"; so Thou givest yet:
    Faith still receives the cup as from Thy hand.

3.  One body we, one body who partake,
    One church united in communion blest;
    One name we bear, one bread of life we break,
    With all Thy saints on earth and saints at rest.

4.  One with each other, Lord, for one in Thee,
    Who art one Savior and one living head;

    In awe and wonder to recall
    His life laid down for me,
    His life laid down for me.

2.  I come with Christians far and near
    To find, as all are fed,
    The new community of love
    In Christ's communion bread,
    In Christ's communion bread.

3.  As Christ breaks bread and bids us share,
    Each proud division ends.
    The love that made us, makes us one,
    And strangers now are friends,
    And strangers now are friends.

4.  And thus with joy we meet our Lord.
    His presence, always near,
    Is in such friendship better known:
    We see and praise Him here,
    We see and praise Him here.

5.  Together met, together bound,
    We'll go our different ways,
    And as His people in the world,
    We'll live and speak His praise,
    We'll live and speak His praise.</lyrics>

    Giving voice to all our sighs,
    Show the wideness of Your mercy
    To deaf ears and blinded eyes;
    Free our tongues to come before You
    With our neighbors' joys and cries.

5.  May Your Word among us spoken,
    May the loving which we dare,
    May Your Bread among us broken,
    May the prayers in which we share 
    Daily make us faithful people,
    Living signs, Lord, of Your care.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  We come as guests invited
    When Jesus bids us dine,
    His friends on earth united
    To share the bread and wine;
    The bread of life is broken,
    The wine is freely poured
    For us, in solemn token
    Of Christ our dying Lord.

2.  We eat and drink, receiving
    From Christ the grace we need,
    And in our hearts believing
    On Him by faith we feed;
    With wonder and thanksgiving
    For love that knows no end,
    We find in Jesus living
    Our ever-present Friend.

3.  One bread is ours for sharing,
    One single fruitful vine,
    Our fellowship declaring
    Renewed in bread and wine:
    Renewed, sustained, and given
    By token, sign, and word,
    The pledge and seal of heaven,
    The love of Christ our Lord.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Sheaves of summer turned golden by the sun,
    Grapes in bunches cut down when ripe and red,
    Are converted into the bread and wine of God's love
    In the body and blood of our dear Lord.

2.  We are sharing the same communion meal,
    We are wheat by the same great Sower sown;
    Like a millstone, life grinds us down with sorrow and pain,
    But God makes us new people bound by love.

3.  Like the grains which become one same whole loaf,
    Like the notes that are woven into song,
    Like the droplets of water that are blended in the sea,
    We, as Christians, one body shall become.

4.  At God's table together we shall sit.
    As God's children, Christ's body we will share.
    One same hope we will sing together as we walk along.
    Brothers, sisters, in life, in love, we'll be.


1.  Una espiga dorada por el sol,
    El racimo que corta el viñador,
    Se convierten ahora en pan y vino de amor,
    En el cuerpo y la sangre del Señor.

2.  Compar timos la misma comunión,
    Somos trigo del mismo sembrador,
    Un molino a la vida nos tritura con dolor,
    Dios nos hace pueblo nuevo en el amor.

3.  Como granos que han hecho el mismo pan,
    Como notas que tejen un cantar,
    Como gotas de agua que se funden en el mar,
    Los cristianos un cuerpo formarán.

4.  En la mesa de Dios se sentarán,
    Como hijos su pan compartirán,
    Una misma esperanza caminando cantaran
    En la vida como hermanos se amarán.</lyrics>

    O may our souls forever feed on Thee,

3.  Fountain of goodness, Jesus, Lord and God,
    Cleanse us, unclean, with Thy most cleansing blood;
    Increase our faith and love, that we may know
    The hope and peace which from Thy presence flow.

    Here would we touch and handle things unseen,
    Here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,
    And all our weariness upon You lean.

2.  We have no help but Yours, nor do we need
    Another arm save Yours to lean upon.
    It is enough, O Lord, enough indeed;
    Our strength is in Your might, Your might alone.

3.  This is the hour of banquet and of song;
    This is the heavenly table for us spread;
    Here let us feast and, feasting, still prolong
    The fellowship of living wine and bread.

4.  Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear.
    The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;
    The bread and wine remove, but You are here,
    Nearer than ever, still our shield and sun.

5.  Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,
    Yet, passing, points to that glad feast above,
    Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,
    The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.</lyrics>

    Triumph in redeeming grace.

    Savior, from the world away,
    Let no fear of death appall us,

    Guard Thou the lips from sin, the hearts from shame,
    That in this house have called upon Thy name.

3.  Grant us Thy peace, Lord, through the coming night;
    Turn Thou for us its darkness into light.
    From harm and danger keep Thy children free,
    For dark and light are both alike to Thee.

4.  Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly life,

    Call us, O Lord, to Thine eternal peace.</lyrics>

    The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
    When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

2.  Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    Change and decay in all around I see.
    O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

3.  I need Thy presence every passing hour;
    What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
    Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
    Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

4.  I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:
    Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
    Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

5.  Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
    Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies:
    Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</lyrics>

    Shines through our night;
    You are with us, ever lending
    New strength to sight:
    One in love, Your truth confessing,
    One in hope of heaven's blessing,
    May we see, in love's possessing,
    Love's endless light!

3.  Eyes will close, but You unsleeping
    Watch by our side;
    Death may come, in love's safekeeping
    Still we abide.
    God of love, all evil quelling,
    Sin forgiving, fear dispelling,
    Stay with us, our hearts indwelling,

3.  Now, our wants and burdens leaving

    At God's touch our burdens fall.

4.  As the darkness deepens o'er us, 
    Lo! eternal stars arise;
    Hope and faith and love rise glorious,
    Shining in the Spirit's skies.
    Jubilate! Jubilate! Jubilate! Amen!
    Hope and faith and love rise glorious,
    Shining in the Spirit's skies.</lyrics>

2.  We thank Thee that Thy church unsleeping,
    While earth rolls onward into light,
    Through all the world a watch is keeping
    And rests not now by day or night.

3.  As o'er each continent and island
    The dawn leads on another day,
    The voice of prayer is never silent,
    Nor dies the strain of praise away.

4.  The sun that bids us rest is waking 
    Thy children 'neath the western sky,
    And hour by hour fresh lips are making
    Thy wondrous doings heard on high.

5.  So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,
    Like earth's proud empires, pass away;
    Thy kingdom stands, and grows forever
    Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  When twilight comes and the sun sets,
    mother hen prepares for night's rest.
    As her brood shelters under her wings
    she gives the love of God to her nest.
    Oh! what joy to feel her warm heart beat
    and be near her all night long;
    so the young can find repose, 
    then renew tomorrow's song.

2.  One day the Rabbi Lord Jesus
    called the Twelve to share His last meal.
    As the hen tends her young, so for them
    He spent Himself to seek and to heal.
    Oh! what joy to be with Christ Jesus,
    hear His voice, Oh! sheer delight,
    and receive His servant care: 
    all before the coming night.

3.  So gather round once again, friends,
    touched by fading glow of sun's gold,
    and recount all our frail human hopes:
    the dreams of young and stories of old.
    Oh! what joy to pray close together,
    kneeling as one family,
    by a mother's love embraced 
    in the blessed Trinity.

    Ere the winter storms begin;
    God, our Maker, doth provide
    For our wants to be supplied:
    Come to God's own temple, come,
    Raise the song of harvest home.

2.  All the world is God's own field,
    Fruit unto God's praise to yield;
    Wheat and tares together sown,
    Unto joy or sorrow grown;
    First the blade, and then the ear,
    Then the full corn shall appear:
    Lord of harvest, grant that we
    Wholesome grain and pure may be.

3.  For the Lord our God shall come,
    And shall take the harvest home;
    From each field shall in that day
    All offenses purge away;
    Give the angels charge at last
    In the fire the tares to cast,
    But the fruitful ears to store
    In God's garner evermore.

4.  Even so, Lord, quickly come
    To Thy final harvest home;
    Gather Thou Thy people in,
    Free from sorrow, free from sin;
    There forever purified, 
    In Thy presence to abide:
    Come, with all Thine angels, come,
    Raise the glorious harvest home.</lyrics>

    We, too, should be voicing
    Our love and rejoicing
    With glad adoration, a song let us raise:
    Till all things now living
    Unite in thanksgiving,
    To God in the highest, hosanna and praise.</lyrics>

    With heart and hands and voices,
    Who wondrous things hath done,
    In whom this world rejoices;
    Who, from our mothers' arms,
    Hath blessed us on our way
    With countless gifts of love,
    And still is ours today.

2.  O may this bounteous God
    Through all our life be near us,
    With ever joyful hearts
    And blessed peace to cheer us;
    And keep us in God's grace,
    And guide us when perplexed,
    And free us from all ills
    In this world and the next.

3.  All praise and thanks to God,
    Who reigns in highest heaven,
    To Father and to Son 
    And Spirit now be given.
    The one eternal God,
    Whom heaven and earth adore,
    The God who was, and is,
    And shall be evermore.</lyrics>

    A love that shows our gratitude 
    through deeds that live our praise.

2.  Give thanks for plains and valleys spaced
    By mountains thrusting high;
    Give thanks by fighting greed and waste
    That drain their treasures dry.

3.  In full thanksgiving for God's love,
    From which earth's blessings flow,
    Protect the precious air above,

4.  Give thanks in hope, rejoice, repent,
    And practice all you prayed;
    True thanks can never be content
    To foul the world God made.

    Amor tan inmenso?
    Que diste tu vida
    Por el pecador;

    Mis ojos en llanto
    En Ti fijaré;
    Alzando mis ojos
    Veré las estrellas,
    Yo sé que tras ellas
    Cual Padre amoroso
    Tú velas por mí,
    Yo sé que tras ellas
    Cual Padre amoroso
    Tú velas por mí.

3.  No puedo pargarte
    Con oro ni plata
    El gran sacrificio
    Que hiciste por mí;
    No tengo que darte
    Por tanto amarme,
    Recibe este canto
    Mezclado con llanto
    Y mi corazón,
    Recibe este canto
    Mezclado con llanto,
    Y mi corazón.</lyrics>

    By God's almighty hand;
    God sends the snow in winter,
    The warmth to swell the grain,

    And soft, refreshing rain.

2.  You only are the Maker
    Of all things near and far;
    You paint the wayside flower,
    You light the evening star;
    The winds and waves obey You,
    By You the birds are fed;
    Much more to us, Your children,
    You give our daily bread.

3.  We thank You, Creator,
    For all things bright and good,
    The seed-time and the harvest,
    Our life, our health, our food;
    Accept the gifts we offer,

    From every mountainside
    Let freedom ring.

2.  My native country, thee,
    Land of the noble free,
    Thy name I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    Thy woods and templed hills;
    My heart with rapture thrills
    Like that above.

3.  Let music swell the breeze,
    And ring from all the trees
    Sweet freedom's song;
    Let mortal tongues awake,
    Let all that breathe partake,
    Let rocks their silence break,
    The sound prolong.

4.  Our *fathers' God, to Thee,
    Author of liberty,
    To Thee we sing;
    Long may our land be bright
    With freedom's holy light;
    Protect us by Thy might,
    Great God, our King.

    O hear us when we cry to Thee
    For those in peril on the sea.

2.  O Savior, whose almighty word
    The wind and waves submissive heard,
    Who walked upon the foaming deep,
    And calm amid its rage did sleep:
    O hear us when we cry to Thee
    For those in peril on the sea.

3.  O Holy Spirit, who did brood
    Upon the chaos wild and rude,
    And bade its angry tumult cease,
    And gave, for fierce confusion, peace:
    O hear us when we cry to Thee
    For those in peril on the sea.

4.  O Trinity of love and power,
    All travelers guard in danger's hour;
    From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
    Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
    Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
    Glad praise from air and land and sea.</lyrics>

    Ring with the harmonies of liberty.
    Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies;
    Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
    Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us;
    Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
    Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
    Let us march on, till victory is won.

2.  Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod,
    Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
    Yet, with a steady beat, have not our weary feet
    Come to the place for which our *fathers sighed?
    We have come over a way that with tears has been watered;
    We have come, treading our path through the blood of the
slaughtered,
    Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last
    Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

3.  God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
    Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;
    Thou who hast by Thy might led us into the light;
    Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
    Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met
Thee;
    Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget
Thee;
    Shadowed beneath Thy hand may we forever stand,
    True to our God, true to our native land.

and that He appeared to the women, and that He appeared to Peter,
then to the Twelve and to many faithful witnesses.
We believe He is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
He is the first and the last, the beginning and the end,
He is our Lord and our God. Amen.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  My soul gives glory to my God,
    My heart pours out its praise.
    God lifted up my lowliness
    In many marvelous ways.

2.  My God has done great things for me:
    Yes, holy is this Name.
    All people will declare me blessed,
    And blessings they shall claim.

3.  From age to age to all who fear,
    Such mercy love imparts,
    Dispensing justice far and near,
    Dismissing selfish hearts.

4.  Love casts the mighty from their thrones,
    Promotes the insecure,
    Leaves hungry spirits satisfied;
    The rich seem suddenly poor.

5.  Praise God, whose loving covenant
    Supports those in distress,
    Remembering past promises
    With present faithfulness.</lyrics>

      <lyrics>1.  Blest be the God of Israel,
    The ever-living Lord.
    You come in power to save Your own,
    Your people Israel.
    For Israel You now raise up
    Salvation's tower on high
    In David's house, who reigned as king
    And servant of the Lord.

2.  Through holy prophets did You speak
    Your word in days of old,
    That You would save us from our foes
    And all who bear us ill.
    On Sinai You gave to us
    Your covenant of love;
    So with us now You keep Your word
    In love that knows no end.

3.  Of old You gave Your solemn oath
    To father Abraham:
    Whose seed a mighty race should be
    And blest forevermore.
    You vowed to set Your people free
    From fear of every foe,
    That we might serve You all our days 
    In goodness, love, and peace.

4.  O tiny child, Your name shall be
    The prophet of the Lord;
    The way of God You will prepare
    To make God's coming known.
    You shall proclaim to Israel
    Salvation's dawning day,
    When God shall wipe away all sins
    With mercy and with love.

5.  The rising sun shall shine on us
    To bring the light of day
    To all who sit in darkest night
    And shadow of the grave.
    Our footsteps God shall safely guide
    To walk the ways of peace,
    Whose name forevermore be blest,
    Who lives and loves and saves.</lyrics>

    Who comes to set us free;
    Who visits and redeems us,
    Who grants us liberty.
    The prophets spoke of mercy,
    Of freedom and release;
    God shall fulfill that promise
    And bring the people peace.

2.  God from the house of David
    A child of grace has given;
    A Savior comes among us
    To raise us up to heaven.
    Before Him goes the herald,
    Forerunner in the way,
    The prophet of salvation,
    The harbinger of day.

3.  On those who sit in darkness
    The sun begins to rise,
    The dawning of forgiveness
    Upon the sinner's eyes.
    God guides the feet of pilgrims
    Along the paths of peace.
    O bless our God and Savior
    With songs that never cease!</lyrics>
